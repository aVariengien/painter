 *How does the culture of science change and improve? Many people have identified shortcomings in core social processes of science, such as peer review, how grants are awarded, how people are selected to become scientists, and so on. Yet despite often compelling criticisms, strong barriers inhibit widespread change in such social processes. The result is near stasis, and apathy about the prospects for improvement. People sometimes start new research institutions intended to do things differently; unfortunately such institutions are often changed more by the existing ecosystem than they change it. In this essay we sketch a vision of how the social processes of science may be rapidly improved. In this vision, metascience plays a key role: it deepens our understanding of which social processes best support discovery; that understanding can then help drive change. We introduce the notion of a metascience entrepreneur, a person seeking to achieve a scalable improvement in the social processes of science. We argue that: (1\) metascience is an imaginative design practice, exploring an enormous design space for social processes; (2\) that exploration aims to find new social processes which unlock latent potential for discovery; (3\) decentralized change must be possible, so outsiders with superior ideas can't be blocked by established power centers; (4\) ideally, change would align with what is best for science and for humanity, not merely what is fashionable, politically popular, or media\- friendly; (5\) the net result would be a far more structurally diverse set of environments for doing science; and (6\) this would enable crucial types of work difficult or impossible within existing environments. For this vision to succeed metascience must develop and intertwine three elements: an imaginative design practice, an entrepreneurial discipline, and a research field. Overall, it is a vision in which metascience is an engine of improvement for the social processes and ultimately the culture of science.*

 How does the culture of science change?
=======================================

 Imagine you're a science fiction author writing a story depicting a scientific discovery made by an alien species. In your story you show the alien scientists up close – how they work, how they live. Would you show them working within institutions resembling human universities, with the PhD system, grant agencies, academic journals, and so on? Would they use social processes like peer review and citation? Would the alien scientists have interminable arguments, as human scientists do, about the merits of the h\-index and impact factor and similar attempts to measure science?

 Almost certainly, the design of our human scientific social processes has been too contingent on the accidents of history for the answers to those questions to all be "yes". It seems unlikely that humanity has found the best possible means of allocating scarce scientific resources! We doubt even the most fervent proponents of, say, Harvard or the US National Science Foundation would regard them as a platonic ideal. Nor does it seem likely the h\-index and similar measures are universal measures of scientific merit.

 This doesn't mean the aliens wouldn't have many scientific facts and methodological ideas in common with humanity – plausibly, for instance, the use of mathematics to describe the universe, or the central role of experiment in improving our understanding. But it also seems likely such aliens will have radically different social processes to support science. What would those social processes be? Could they have developed scientific institutions as superior to ours as modern universities are to the learned medieval monasteries?

 The question "how would aliens do science?" is fun to consider, if fanciful. But it's also a good stimulus for immediately human\-relevant questions. For instance: suppose you were given a large sum of money – say, a hundred million dollars, or a billion dollars, or even ten or a hundred billion or a trillion dollars – and asked to start a new scientific institution, perhaps a research institute or funder. What would you do with the money?
