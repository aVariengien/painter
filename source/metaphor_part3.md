 Indirect Understanding

 We have just described how we understand aspects of a situation that are fairly clearly delineated in our direct experience. But we have seen throughout this work that many aspects of our experience cannot be clearly delineated in terms of the naturally emergent dimensions of our experience. This is typically the case for human emotions, abstract concepts, mental activity, time, work, human institutions, social practices, etc., and even for physical objects that have no inherent boundaries or orientations. Though most of these can be experienced directly, none of them can be fully comprehended on their own terms. Instead, we must understand them in terms of other entities and experiences, typically other kinds of entities and experiences.

 As we saw, understanding a situation where we see the fog as being in front of the mountain requires us to view the fog and the mountain as entities. It also requires us to project a front\-back orientation upon the mountain. These projections are built into our very perception. We perceive the fog and the mountain as entities and we perceive the mountain as having a front, with the fog in front of it. The front\-back orientation that we perceive for the mountain is obviously an interactional property, as is the status of the fog and the mountain as entities. Here we have a case of indirect understanding, where we are understanding physical phenomena in terms of other more clearly delineated physical phenomena.

 What we do in indirect understanding is to use the resources of direct understanding. In the case of the fog and the mountain, we are using entity structure and orientational structure. In this case we stayed within a single domain, that of physical objects. But most of our indirect understanding involves understanding one kind of entity or experience in terms of another kind—that is, understanding via metaphor. As we have seen, all of the resources that are used in direct, immediate understanding are pressed into service in indirect understanding via metaphor.

 
> Entity structure: Entity and substance structure is imposed via ontological metaphor.
> 
>  Orientational structure: Orientational structure is imposed via orientational metaphor.
> 
>  Dimensions of experience: Structural metaphor involves structuring one kind of thing or experience in terms of another kind, but the same natural dimensions of experience are used in both (e.g., parts, stages, purposes, etc.).
> 
>  Experiential gestalts: Structural metaphor involves imposing part of one gestalt structure upon another.
> 
>  Background: Experiential gestalts play the role of a background in metaphorical understanding, just as they do in nonmetaphorical understanding.
> 
>  Highlighting: Metaphorical highlighting works by the same mechanism as that for nonmetaphorical gestalts. That is, the experiential gestalt that is superimposed in the situation via the metaphor picks out elements of the situation as fitting its dimensions—it picks out its own participants, parts, stages, etc. These are what the metaphor highlights, and what is not highlighted is downplayed or hidden.
> 
>  Since new metaphors highlight things not usually highlighted by our normal conceptual structure, they have become the most celebrated examples of highlighting.
> 
>  Interactional properties: All of the dimensions of our experience are interactional in nature, and all experiential gestalts involve interactional properties. This holds for both metaphorical and nonmetaphorical concepts.
> 
>  Prototypes: Both metaphorical and nonmetaphorical categories are structured in terms of prototypes.

 Truth Is Based on Understanding

 We have seen that the same eight aspects of our conceptual system that go into direct immediate understanding of situations play parallel roles in indirect understanding. These aspects of our normal conceptual system are used whether we are understanding a situation in metaphorical or nonmetaphorical terms. It is because we understand situations in terms of our conceptual system that we can understand statements using that system of concepts as being true, that is, as fitting or not fitting the situation as we understand it. Truth is therefore a function of our conceptual system. It is because many of our concepts are metaphorical in nature, and because we understand situations in terms of those concepts, that metaphors can be true or false.

 The Nature of the Experientialist Account of Truth

 
> We understand a statement as being true in a given situation when our understanding of the statement fits our understanding of the situation closely enough for our purposes.

 This is the foundation of our experientialist theory of truth, which has the following characteristics.

 First, our theory has some elements in common with a correspondence theory. According to the most rudimentary correspondence view, a statement has an objective meaning, which specifies the conditions under which it is true. Truth consists of a direct fit (or correspondence) between a statement and some state of affairs in the world.

 We reject such a simplistic picture, primarily because it ignores the way in which truth is based on understanding. The experientialist view we are proposing is a correspondence theory in the following sense:

 
> A theory of truth is a theory of what it means to understand a statement as true or false in a certain situation.
> 
>  Any correspondence between what we say and some state of affairs in the world is always mediated by our understanding of the statement and of the state of affairs. Of course, our understanding of the situation results from our interaction with the situation itself. But we are able to make true (or false) statements about the world because it is possible for our understanding of a statement to fit (or not fit) our understanding of the situation in which the statement is made.
> 
>  Since we understand situations and statements in terms of our conceptual system, truth for us is always relative to that conceptual system. Likewise, since an understanding is always partial, we have no access to "the whole truth" or to any definitive account of reality.

 Second, understanding something requires fitting it into a coherent scheme, relative to a conceptual system. Thus, truth will always depend partly on coherence. This gives us elements of a coherence theory.

 Third, understanding also requires a grounding in experience. On the experientialist view, our conceptual system emerges from our constant successful functioning in our physical and cultural environment. Our categories of experience and the dimensions out of which they are constructed not only have emerged from our experience but are constantly being tested through ongoing successful functioning by all the members of our culture. This gives us elements of a pragmatic theory.

 Fourth, the experientialist theory of truth has some elements in common with classical realism, but these do not include its insistence on absolute truth. Instead, it takes as given that:

 
> The physical world is what it is. Cultures are what they are. People are what they are.
> 
>  People successfully interact in their physical and cultural environments. They are constantly interacting with the real world.
> 
>  Human categorization is constrained by reality, since it is characterized in terms of natural dimensions of experience that are constantly tested through physical and cultural interaction.
> 
>  Classical realism focuses on physical reality rather than cultural and personal reality. But social, political, economic, and religious institutions and the human beings who function within them are no less real than trees, tables, or rocks. Since our account of truth deals with social and personal reality as well as physical reality, it can be considered an attempt to extend the realist tradition.
> 
>  The experientialist theory varies from classical objective realism in the following basic way: Human concepts do not correspond to inherent properties of things but only to interactional properties. This is natural, since concepts can be metaphorical in nature and can vary from culture to culture.

 Fifth, people with very different conceptual systems than our own may understand the world in a very different way than we do. Thus, they may have a very different body of truths than we have and even different criteria for truth and reality.

 It should be obvious from this description that there is nothing radically new in our account of truth. It includes some of the central insights of the phenomenological tradition, such as the rejection of epistemological foundationalism, the stress on the centrality of the body in the structuring of our experience, and the importance of that structure in understanding. Our view also accords with some of the key elements of Wittgenstein's later philosophy: the family\-resemblance account of categorization, the rejection of the picture theory of meaning, the rejection of a building\-block theory of meaning, and the emphasis on meaning as relative to context and to one's own conceptual system.

 Elements of Human Understanding in Theories of "Objective Truth"

 A theory of truth based on understanding is obviously not a theory of "purely objective truth." We do not believe that there is such a thing as absolute truth, and we think that it is pointless to try to give a theory of it. However, it is traditional in Western philosophy to assume that absolute truth is possible and to undertake to give an account of it. We would like to point out how the most prominent contemporary approaches to the problem build in aspects of human understanding, which they claim to exclude.

 The most obvious case is the account of truth given within model\-theoretic approaches, say, for example, those done within the Kripke and Montague traditions. The models are constructed out of a universe of discourse that is taken to be a set of entities. Relative to this set of entities, we can define world states, in which all the properties that the entities have and all the relations among them are specified. It is assumed that this concept of a world state is sufficiently general to apply to any conceivable situation, including the real world. In such a system, sentences like "The fog is in front of the mountain" would present no problem, since there would be an entity corresponding to the fog, an entity corresponding to the mountain, and a relation in front of, relating the two entities. But such models do not correspond to the world in itself, free of human understanding, since there are in the world no well\-defined entities corresponding to the mountain and the fog and there is no inherent front to the mountain. The entity structure and the front\-back orientation are imposed by virtue of human understanding. Any attempt to give an account of the truth of "The fog is in front of the mountain" in such model\-theoretic terms will not be an account of objective, absolute truth, since it involves building elements of human understanding into the models.

 The same can be said of attempts to provide a theory of truth meeting the constraints of the classic Tarski truth definition:

 
> "S" is true if and only if S ...

 or more up\-to\-date versions like:

 
> "S" is true if and only if ρ (where ρ is a statement in some universally applicable logical language)

 The prototype for such theories, the well\-worn

 
> "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white.

 seems reasonable enough, since there could reasonably be thought to be a sense in which snow is objectively identifiable and in which it is inherently white. But what about

 
> "The fog is in front of the mountain" is true if and only if the fog is in front of the mountain.

 Since the world does not contain clearly identifiable entities the fog and the mountain, and since mountains don't have inherent fronts, the theory can work only relative to some human understanding of what a front is for a mountain and to some delineation of fog and mountain. The problem is even trickier, since not all human beings have the same way of projecting fronts onto mountains. Here some elements of human understanding must be brought in to make the truth definition work.

 There is another important difference between our account of truth in terms of understanding and the standard attempts to give an account of truth free of human understanding. The different accounts of truth give rise to different accounts of meaning. For us, meaning depends on understanding. A sentence can't mean anything to you unless you understand it. Moreover, meaning is always meaning to someone. There is no such thing as a meaning of a sentence in itself, independent of any people. When we speak of the meaning of a sentence, it is always the meaning of the sentence to someone, a real person or a hypothetical typical member of a speech community.

 Here our theory differs radically from standard theories of meaning. The standard theories assume that it is possible to give an account of truth in itself, free of human understanding, and that the theory of meaning will be based on such a theory of truth. We see no possibility for any such program to work and think that the only answer is to base both the theory of meaning and the theory of truth on a theory of understanding. Metaphor, both conventional and nonconventional, plays a central role in such a program. Metaphors are basically devices for understanding and have little to do with objective reality, if there is such a thing. The fact that our conceptual system is inherently metaphorical, the fact that we understand the world, think, and function in metaphorical terms, and the fact that metaphors can not merely be understood but can be meaningful and true as well—these facts all suggest that an adequate account of meaning and truth can only be based on understanding.

 The Myths of Objectivism and Subjectivism

 The Choices Our Culture Offers

 We have given an account of the way in which truth is based on understanding. We have argued that truth is always relative to a conceptual system, that any human conceptual system is mostly metaphorical in nature, and that, therefore, there is no fully objective, unconditional, or absolute truth. To many people raised in the culture of science or in other subcultures where absolute truth is taken for granted, this will be seen as a surrender to subjectivity and arbitrariness—to the Humpty\-Dumpty notion that something means "just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less." For the same reason, those who identify with the Romantic tradition may see any victory over objectivism as a triumph of imagination over science—a triumph of the view that each individual makes his own reality, free of any constraints.

 Either of these views would be a misunderstanding based on the mistaken cultural assumption that the only alternative to objectivism is radical subjectivity—that is, either you believe in absolute truth or you can make the world in your own image. If you're not being objective, you're being subjective, and there is no third choice. We see ourselves as offering a third choice to the myths of objectivism and subjectivism.

 Incidentally, we are not using the term "myth" in any derogatory way. Myths provide ways of comprehending experience; they give order to our lives. Like metaphors, myths are necessary for making sense of what goes on around us. All cultures have myths, and people cannot function without myth any more than they can function without metaphor. And just as we often take the metaphors of our own culture as truths, so we often take the myths of our own culture as truths. The myth of objectivism is particularly insidious in this way. Not only does it purport not to be a myth, but it makes both myths and metaphors objects of belittlement and scorn: according to the objectivist myth, myths and metaphors cannot be taken seriously because they are not objectively true. As we will see, the myth of objectivism is itself not objectively true. But this does not make it something to be scorned or ridiculed. The myth of objectivism is part of the everyday functioning of every member of this culture. It needs to be examined and understood. We also think it needs to be supplemented— not by its opposite, the myth of subjectivism, but by a new experientialist myth, which we think better fits the realities of our experience. In order to get clear about what an experientialist alternative would be like, we first need to examine the myths of objectivism and subjectivism in detail.

 The Myth of Objectivism

 The myth of objectivism says that:

 1\. The world is made up of objects. They have properties independent of any people or other beings who experience them. For example, take a rock. It's a separate object and it's hard. Even if no people or other beings existed in the universe, it would still be a separate object and it would still be hard.

 2\. We get our knowledge of the world by experiencing the objects in it and getting to know what properties the objects have and how these objects are related to one another. For example, we find out that a rock is a separate object by looking at it, feeling it, moving it around, etc. We find out that it's hard by touching it, trying to squeeze it, kicking it, banging it against something softer, etc.

 3\. We understand the objects in our world in terms of categories and concepts. These categories and concepts correspond to properties the objects have in themselves (inherently) and to the relationships among the objects. Thus, we have a word "rock," which corresponds to a concept ROCK. Given a rock, we can tell that it is in the category ROCK and that a piano, a tree, or a tiger would not be. Rocks have inherent properties independent of any beings: they're solid, hard, dense, occur in nature, etc. We understand what a "rock" is in terms of these properties.

 4\. There is an objective reality, and we can say things that are objectively, absolutely, and unconditionally true and false about it. But, as human beings, we are subject to human error, that is, illusions, errors of perception, errors of judgment, emotions, and personal and cultural biases. We cannot rely upon the subjective judgments of individual people. Science provides us with a methodology that allows us to rise above our subjective limitations and to achieve understanding from a universally valid and unbiased point of view. Science can ultimately give a correct, definitive, and general account of reality, and, through its methodology, it is constantly progressing toward that goal.

 5\. Words have fixed meanings. That is, our language expresses the concepts and categories that we think in terms of. To describe reality correctly, we need words whose meanings are clear and precise, words that fit reality. These may be words that arise naturally, or they may be technical terms in a scientific theory.

 6\. People can be objective and can speak objectively, but they can do so only if they use language that is clearly and precisely defined, that is straightforward and direct, and that can fit reality. Only by speaking in this way can people communicate precisely about the external world and make statements that can be judged objectively to be true or false.

 7\. Metaphor and other kinds of poetic, fanciful, rhetorical, or figurative language can always be avoided in speaking objectively, and they should be avoided, since their meanings are not clear and precise and do not fit reality in any obvious way.

 8\. Being objective is generally a good thing. Only objective knowledge is really knowledge. Only from an objective, unconditional point of view can we really understand ourselves, others, and the external world. Objectivity allows us to rise above personal prejudice and bias, to be fair, and to take an unbiased view of the world.

 9\. To be objective is to be rational; to be subjective is to be irrational and to give in to the emotions.

 10\. Subjectivity can be dangerous, since it can lead to losing touch with reality. Subjectivity can be unfair, since it takes a personal point of view and can, therefore, be biased. Subjectivity is self\-indulgent, since it exaggerates the importance of the individual.

 The Myth of Subjectivism

 The myth of subjectivism says that:

 1\. In most of our everyday practical activities we rely on our senses and develop intuitions we can trust. When important issues arise, regardless of what others may say, our own senses and intuitions are our best guides for action.

 2\. The most important things in our lives are our feelings, aesthetic sensibilities, moral practices, and spiritual awareness. These are purely subjective. None of these is purely rational or objective.

 3\. Art and poetry transcend rationality and objectivity and put us in touch with the more important reality of our feelings and intuitions. We gain this awareness through imagination rather than reason.

 4\. The language of the imagination, especially metaphor, is necessary for expressing the unique and most personally significant aspects of our experience. In matters of personal understanding the ordinary agreed\-upon meanings that words have will not do.

 5\. Objectivity can be dangerous, because it misses what is most important and meaningful to individual people. Objectivity can be unfair, since it must ignore the most relevant realms of our experience in favor of the abstract, universal, and impersonal. For the same reason, objectivity can be inhuman. There are no objective and rational means for getting at our feelings, our aesthetic sensibilities, etc. Science is of no use when it comes to the most important things in our lives.

 Fear of Metaphor

 Objectivism and subjectivism need each other in order to exist. Each defines itself in opposition to the other and sees the other as the enemy. Objectivism takes as its allies scientific truth, rationality, precision, fairness, and impartiality. Subjectivism takes as its allies the emotions, intuitive insight, imagination, humaneness, art, and a "higher" truth. Each is master in its own realm and views its realm as the better of the two. They coexist, but in separate domains. Each of us has a realm in his life where it is appropriate to be objective and a realm where it is appropriate to be subjective. The portions of our lives governed by objectivism and subjectivism vary greatly from person to person and from culture to culture. Some of us even attempt to live our entire lives totally by one myth or the other.

 In Western culture as a whole, objectivism is by far the greater potentate, claiming to rule, at least nominally, the realms of science, law, government, journalism, morality, business, economics, and scholarship. But, as we have argued, objectivism is a myth.

 Since the time of the Greeks, there has been in Western culture a tension between truth, on the one hand, and art, on the other, with art viewed as illusion and allied, via its link with poetry and theater, to the tradition of persuasive public oratory. Plato viewed poetry and rhetoric with suspicion and banned poetry from his Utopian Republic because it gives no truth of its own, stirs up the emotions, and thereby blinds mankind to the real truth. Plato, typical of persuasive writers, stated his view that truth is absolute and art mere illusion by the use of a powerful rhetorical device, his Allegory of the Cave. To this day, his metaphors dominate Western philosophy, providing subtle and elegant expression for his view that truth is absolute. Aristotle, on the other hand, saw poetry as having a positive value: "It is a great thing, indeed, to make proper use of the poetic forms,... But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor" (Poetics 1459a); "ordinary words convey only what we know already ; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh" (Rhetoric 1410b).

 But although Aristotle's theory of how metaphors work is the classic view, his praise of metaphor's ability to induce insight was never carried over into modern philosophical thought. With the rise of empirical science as a model for truth, the suspicion of poetry and rhetoric became dominant in Western thought, with metaphor and other figurative devices becoming objects of scorn once again. Hobbes, for example, finds metaphors absurd and misleadingly emotional; they are "ignes fatui; and reasoning upon them is wandering amongst innumerable absurdities; and their end, contention and sedition, or contempt" (Leviathan, pt. 1, chap. 5\). Hobbes finds absurdity in "the use of metaphors, tropes, and other rhetorical figures, instead of words proper. For though it be lawful to say, for example in common speech, the way goeth, or leadeth hither, or thither; the proverb says this or that, whereas ways cannot go, nor proverbs speak; yet in reckoning, and seeking of truth, such speeches are not to be admitted" (ibid.).

 Locke, continuing the empiricist tradition, shows the same contempt for figurative speech, which he views as a tool of rhetoric and an enemy of truth:

 
> ... if we would speak of things as they are, we must allow that all the art of rhetoric, besides order and clearness; all the artificial and figurative application of words eloquence hath invented, are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas, move the passions, and thereby mislead the judgment; and so indeed are perfect cheats: and therefore, however laudable or allowable oratory may render them in harangues and popular addresses, they are certainly, in all discourses that pretend to inform or instruct, wholly to be avoided; and where truth and knowledge are concerned, cannot but be thought a great fault, either of the language or person that makes use of them\_\_\_\_It is evident how much men love to deceive and be deceived, since rhetoric, that powerful instrument of error and deceit, has its established professors, is publicly taught, and has always been had in great reputation. \[Essay Concerning Human Understanding, bk. 3, chap. 10]

 The fear of metaphor and rhetoric in the empiricist tradition is a fear of subjectivism—a fear of emotion and the imagination. Words are viewed as having "proper senses" in terms of which truths can be expressed. To use words metaphorically is to use them in an improper sense, to stir the imagination and thereby the emotions and thus to lead us away from the truth and toward illusion. The empiricist distrust and fear of metaphor is wonderfully summed up by Samuel Parker:

 
> All those Theories in Philosophy which are expressed only in metaphorical Termes, are not real Truths, but the meer products of Imagination, dress'd up (like Childrens babies) in a few spangled empty words\_\_\_\_ Thus their wanton and luxuriant fancies climbing up into the Bed of Reason, do not only defile it by unchaste and illegitimate Embraces, but instead of real conceptions and notices of Things, impregnate the mind with nothing but Ayerie and Subventaneous Phantasmes. \[Free and Impartial Censure of the Platonick Philosophy (1666\)]

 As science became more powerful via technology and the Industrial Revolution became a dehumanizing reality, there occurred a reaction among poets, artists, and occasional philosophers: the development of the Romantic tradition. Wordsworth and Coleridge gladly left reason, science, and objectivity to the dehumanized empiricists and exalted imagination as a more humane means of achieving a higher truth, with emotion as a natural guide to self\- understanding. Science, reason, and technology had alienated man from himself and his natural environment, or so the Romantics alleged; they saw poetry, art, and a return to nature as a way for man to recover his lost humanity. Art and poetry were seen, not as products of reason, but as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings." The result of this Romantic view was the alienation of the artist and poet from mainstream society.

 The Romantic tradition, by embracing subjectivism, reinforced the dichotomy between truth and reason, on the one hand, and art and imagination, on the other. By giving up on rationality, the Romantics played into the hands of the myth of objectivism, whose power has continued to increase ever since. The Romantics did, however, create a domain for themselves, where subjectivism continues to hold sway. It is an impoverished domain compared to that of objectivism. In terms of real power in our society—in science, law, government, business, and the media—the myth of objectivism reigns supreme. Subjectivism has carved out a domain for itself in art and perhaps in religion. Most people in this culture see it as an appendage to the realm of objectivism and a retreat for the emotions and the imagination.

 The Third Choice: An Experientialist Synthesis

 What we are offering in the experientialist account of understanding and truth is an alternative which denies that subjectivity and objectivity are our only choices. We reject the objectivist view that there is absolute and unconditional truth without adopting the subjectivist alternative of truth as obtainable only through the imagination, unconstrained by external circumstances. The reason we have focused so much on metaphor is that it unites reason and imagination. Reason, at the very least, involves categorization, entailment, and inference. Imagination, in one of its many aspects, involves seeing one kind of thing in terms of another kind of thing—what we have called metaphorical thought. Metaphor is thus imaginative rationality. Since the categories of our everyday thought are largely metaphorical and our everyday reasoning involves metaphorical entailments and inferences, ordinary rationality is therefore imaginative by its very nature. Given our understanding of poetic metaphor in terms of metaphorical entailments and inferences, we can see that the products of the poetic imagination are, for the same reason, partially rational in nature.

 Metaphor is one of our most important tools for trying to comprehend partially what cannot be comprehended totally: our feelings, aesthetic experiences, moral practices, and spiritual awareness. These endeavors of the imagination are not devoid of rationality; since they use metaphor, they employ an imaginative rationality.

 An experientialist approach also allows us to bridge the gap between the objectivist and subjectivist myths about impartiality and the possibility of being fair and objective. The two choices offered by the myths are absolute objectivity, on the one hand, and purely subjective intuition, on the other. We have seen that truth is relative to understanding, which means that there is no absolute standpoint from which to obtain absolute objective truths about the world. This does not mean that there are no truths; it means only that truth is relative to our conceptual system, which is grounded in, and constantly tested by, our experiences and those of other members of our culture in our daily interactions with other people and with our physical and cultural environments.

 Though there is no absolute objectivity, there can be a kind of objectivity relative to the conceptual system of a culture. The point of impartiality and fairness in social matters is to rise above relevant individual biases. The point of objectivity in scientific experimentation is to factor out the effects of individual illusion and error. This is not to say that we can always, or even ever, be completely successful in factoring out individual biases to achieve complete objectivity relative to a conceptual system and a cultural set of values. It is only to say that pure subjective intuition is not always our only recourse. Nor is this to say that the concepts and values of a particular culture constitute the final arbiter of fairness within the culture. There may be, and typically are, transcultural concepts and values that define a standard of fairness very different from that of a particular culture. What was fair in Nazi Germany, for example, was not fair in the eyes of the world community. Closer to home, there are court cases that constantly involve issues of fairness across subcultures with conflicting values. Here the majority culture usually gets to define fairness relative to its values, but these mainstream cultural values change over time and are often subject to criticism by other cultures.

 What the myths of objectivism and subjectivism both miss is the way we understand the world through our interactions with it. What objectivism misses is the fact that understanding, and therefore truth, is necessarily relative to our cultural conceptual systems and that it cannot be framed in any absolute or neutral conceptual system. Objectivism also misses the fact that human conceptual systems are metaphorical in nature and involve an imaginative understanding of one kind of thing in terms of another. What subjectivism specifically misses is that our understanding, even our most imaginative understanding, is given in terms of a conceptual system that is grounded in our successful functioning in our physical and cultural environments. It also misses the fact that metaphorical understanding involves metaphorical entailment, which is an imaginative form of rationality.

 The Myth of Objectivism in Western Philosophy and Linguistics

 Our Challenge to the Myth of Objectivism

 The myth of objectivism has dominated Western culture, and in particular Western philosophy, from the Presocratics to the present day. The view that we have access to absolute and unconditional truths about the world is the cornerstone of the Western philosophical tradition. The myth of objectivity has flourished in both the rationalist and empiricist traditions, which in this respect differ only in their accounts of how we arrive at such absolute truths. For the rationalists, only our innate capacity to reason can give us knowledge of things as they really are. For the empiricists, all our knowledge of the world arises from our sense perceptions (either directly or indirectly) and is constructed out of the elements of sensation. Kant's synthesis of rationalism and empiricism falls within the objectivist tradition also, despite his claim that there can be no knowledge whatever of things as they are in themselves. What makes Kant an objectivist is his claim that, relative to the kinds of things that all human beings can experience through their senses (his empiricist legacy), we can have universally valid knowledge and universally valid moral laws by the use of our universal reason (his rationalist legacy). The objectivist tradition in Western philosophy is preserved to this day in the descendants of the logical positivists, the Fregean tradition, the tradition of Husserl, and, in linguistics, in the neorationalism that came out of the Chomsky tradition.

 Our account of metaphor goes against this tradition. We see metaphor as essential to human understanding and as a mechanism for creating new meaning and new realities in our lives. This puts us at odds with most of the Western philosophical tradition, which has seen metaphor as an agent of subjectivism and, therefore, as subversive of the quest for absolute truth. In addition, our views on conventional metaphor— that it pervades our conceptual system and is a primary mechanism for understanding— put us at odds with the contemporary views of language, meaning, truth, and understanding that dominate recent Anglo\-American analytic philosophy and go unquestioned in much of modern linguistics and other disciplines as well. The following is a representative list of these assumptions about language, meaning, truth, and understanding. Not all objectivist philosophers and linguists accept all of them, but the most influential figures seem to accept most of them.

 
> Truth is a matter of fitting words to the world.
> 
>  A theory of meaning for natural language is based on a theory of truth, independent of the way people understand and use language.
> 
>  Meaning is objective and disembodied, independent of human understanding.
> 
>  Sentences are abstract objects with inherent structures.
> 
>  The meaning of a sentence can be obtained from the meanings of its parts and the structure of the sentence.
> 
>  Communication is a matter of a speaker's transmitting a message with a fixed meaning to a hearer.
> 
>  How a person understands a sentence, and what it means to him, is a function of the objective meaning of the sentence and what the person believes about the world and about the context in which the sentence is uttered.

 Our account of conventional metaphor is inconsistent with all of these assumptions. The meaning of a sentence is given in terms of a conceptual structure. As we have seen, most of the conceptual structure of a natural language is metaphorical in nature. The conceptual structure is grounded in physical and cultural experience, as are the conventional metaphors. Meaning, therefore, is never disembodied or objective and is always grounded in the acquisition and use of a conceptual system. Moreover, truth is always given relative to a conceptual system and the metaphors that structure it. Truth is therefore not absolute or objective but is based on understanding. Thus sentences do not have inherent, objectively given meanings, and communication cannot be merely the transmission of such meanings.

 It is not at all obvious why our account of these matters is so different from the standard philosophical and linguistic positions. The basic reason seems to be that all of the standard positions are based on the myth of objectivism, while our account of metaphor is inconsistent with it. Such a radical divergence from the dominant theories of such basic matters calls for explanation. How could it be possible for an account of metaphor to call into question the fundamental assumptions about truth, meaning, and understanding that have emerged from the dominant trends in the Western philosophical tradition? An answer to this requires a far more detailed account of the objectivist assumptions about language, truth, and meaning than we have given so far. It requires stating in more detail (a) what the objectivist assumptions are, (b) how they are motivated, and (c) what their implications are for a general account of language, truth, and meaning.

 The point of this analysis is not merely to distinguish our views on language from the standard views but to show by example how influential the myth of objectivism is in Western culture in ways that we usually don't notice. More importantly, we want to suggest that many of the problem areas for our culture may come from a blind acceptance of the myth of objectivism and that there is another alternative short of recourse to radical subjectivity.

 How Standard Theories of Meaning Are Rooted in the Myth of Objectivism

 The myth of objectivism, which is the basis of the objectivist tradition, has very specific consequences for a theory of meaning. We would like to show just what these consequences are, how they arise from the myth of objectivism, and why they are untenable from an experientialist point of view. Not all objectivists hold all of the following positions, but it is common for objectivists to hold most of them in some form or other.

 Meaning Is Objective

 The objectivist characterizes meaning purely in terms of conditions of objective truth or falsity. On the objectivist view, the conventions of the language assign to each sentence an objective meaning, which determines objective truth conditions, given certain elements of context called "indexicals": who the speaker is, who his audience is, the time and place of the utterance, the objects referred to by words like "that," "this," etc. Thus, the objective meaning of a sentence does not depend on the way any given person happens to understand it or on whether he understands it at all. For example, a parrot might be trained to say "It's raining" without any understanding at all of the meaning of this in English. But the sentence has the same objective meaning whether it is said by a parrot or a person, and it will be true if it happens to be raining and false if it isn't raining. Given the objectivist account of meaning, a person understands the objective meaning of a sentence if he understands the conditions under which it would be true or false.

 The objectivist assumes not only that conditions of objective truth and falsity exist but that people have access to them. This is taken as being obvious. Look around you. If there is a pencil on the floor, then the sentence "There is a pencil on the floor" is true, and, if you speak English and can perceive the pencil on the floor, you will correctly take it as being true. It is assumed that such sentences are objectively true or false and that you have access to innumerable such truths. Since people can understand the conditions under which a sentence can be objectively true, it is possible for a language to have conventions by which such objective meanings are assigned to sentences. Thus, on the objectivist view, the conventions that a language has for pairing sentences with objective meanings will depend upon speakers of the language being able to understand the sentence as having that objective meaning. Thus, when the objectivist speaks of understanding the (literal) meaning of a sentence, he is speaking of understanding what makes a sentence objectively true or false. In general, the objectivist notion of understanding is limited to understanding conditions of truth or falsity.

 This is not what we have meant by "understanding." When we say that the objectivist views meaning as being independent of understanding, we are taking "understanding" in our sense and not his.

 Meaning Is Disembodied

 In the objectivist view, objective meaning is not meaning to anyone. Expressions in a natural language can be said to have objective meaning only if that meaning is independent of anything human beings do, either in speaking or in acting. That is, meaning must be disembodied. Frege, for example, distinguishes the "sense" (Sinn), the objective meaning for a sign, from the "idea," which arises

 
> from memories and sense impressions that I have had and acts, both internal and external, which I have performed.... The idea is subjective\_\_\_\_In the light of this, one need have no scruples in speaking simply of the sense, whereas in the case of an idea one must, strictly speaking, add to whom it belongs and at what time. \[Frege, 1966, pp. 59\-60]

 Frege's "sense" is objective disembodied meaning. Each linguistic expression in a language has a disembodied meaning associated with it. This is reminiscent of the CONDUIT metaphor, where "The meaning is right there in the words."

 The Fregean tradition continues to this day in the work of the disciples of Richard Montague and many others as well. In none of this work on semantics is the meaning of the sentence taken to depend in any way on the way a human being would understand it. As Montague puts it, "Like Donald Davidson, I regard the construction of a theory of truth—or rather, of the more general notion of truth under an arbitrary interpretation—as the basic goal of a serious syntax and semantics" (1974, p. 188\). The important words here are "arbitrary interpretation." Montague assumed that theories of meaning and truth are purely mathematical enterprises, and his goal was to maintain an "arbitrary interpretation," untainted by anything at all having to do with human beings, especially matters of human psychology or human understanding. He intended his work to be applicable to any kind of being at all in the universe and to be free of any limitation imposed by any particular kind of being.

 Fitting the Words to the World without People or Human Understanding

 The objectivist tradition views semantics as the study of how linguistic expressions can fit the world directly, without the intervention of human understanding. Perhaps the clearest statement of this position is given by David Lewis:

 
> My proposals will also not conform to the expectations of those who, in analyzing meaning, turn immediately to the psychology and sociology of language users: to intentions, senseexperience, and mental ideas, or to social rules, conventions, and regularities. I distinguish two topics: first, the description of possible languages or grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are associated with aspects of the world; and second, the description of the psychological and sociological facts whereby a particular one of these abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or population. Only confusion comes of mixing these two topics. \[Lewis 1972, p. 170]

 Here Lewis follows the practice of Montague in trying to give an account of how language can fit the world—"how symbols are associated with aspects of the world"—that is sufficiently general and sufficiently arbitrary that it could fit any conceivable psychological or sociological facts about how people use language and how they understand it.

 A Theory of Meaning Is Based on a Theory of Truth

 The possibility of an account of objective truth, independent of any human understanding, makes a theory of objective meaning possible. Under the objectivist account of truth, it is possible for a sentence by itself to fit the world or not. If it does, it is true; if not, it is false. This gives rise directly to an objectivist account of meaning as based on truth. Again, David Lewis puts it most clearly: "A meaning for a sentence is something that determines the conditions under which the sentence is true or false" (1972, p. 173\).

 This has been generalized to give meanings for performative sentences, like orders and promises, by the technique in Lakoff (1972\) and Lewis (1972\). The technique uses the definition of truth in terms of "fitting the world, " which is technically defined by conditions of satisfaction in a model. Felicity conditions of speech acts are similarly defined in terms of conditions of satisfaction, or "fitting the world." When we speak of "truth" and "falsity" below, it should be understood that we are speaking in terms of conditions of satisfaction and that we are including speech acts as well as statements.

 Meaning Is Independent of Use

 The objectivist account of truth requires that meaning, too, be objective. If meaning is to be objective, it must exclude all subjective elements—that is, anything peculiar to a particular context, culture, or mode of understanding. As Donald Davidson puts it: "Literal meaning and truth conditions can be assigned to words and sentences apart from particular contexts of use" (1978, p. 33\).

 Meaning Is Compositional—The Building\-Block Theory

 According to the myth of objectivism, the world is made up of objects; they have well\-defined inherent properties, independent of any being who experiences them, and there are fixed relations holding among them at any given point in time. These aspects of the myth of objectivism give rise to a building\-block theory of meaning. If the world is made up of well\-defined objects, we can give them names in a language. If the objects have well\- defined inherent properties, we can have a language with one\-place predicates corresponding to each of those properties. And if the objects stand in fixed relations to one another (at least at any given instant), we can have a language with many\-place predicates corresponding to each relation.

 Assuming that the world is this way and that we have such a language, we can, using the syntax of this language, construct sentences that can correspond directly to any situation in the world. The meaning of the whole sentence will be its truth conditions, that is, the conditions under which the sentence can be fitted to some situation. The meaning of the whole sentence will depend entirely on the meanings of its parts and how they fit together. The meanings of the parts will specify what names can pick out what objects and what predicates can pick out what properties and relations.

 Objectivist theories of meaning are all compositional in nature—that is, they are all building\-block theories—and they have to be. The reason is that, for the objectivist, the world is made up of building blocks: definable objects and clearly delineated inherent properties and relations. Moreover, every sentence of the language must contain all of the necessary building blocks so that, together with the syntax, nothing more is needed to provide the truth conditions of the sentence. The "something more" that is ruled out is any kind of human understanding.

 Objectivism Permits Ontological Relativity without Human Understanding

 The logical positivists (e.g., Carnap) attempted to carry out an objectivist program by trying to construct a universally applicable formal (logical) language that had all of the building\-block properties mentioned above and all of the other characteristics we have discussed so far. Richard Montague (1974\) claimed to have provided a "universal grammar" that would map natural languages onto such a universally applicable formal language.

 Quine, reacting to such universalist claims, argued that each language has its own ontology built into it, and what counts as an object, property, or relation may vary from language to language. This position is known as the "ontological relativity" thesis.

 It is possible to maintain an ontological relativity thesis within the confines of the objectivist program without any recourse to human understanding or cultural difference. Such a relativistic position gives up on the possibility of constructing a single universally applicable logical language into which all natural languages can be translated adequately. It claims instead that each natural language carves up what is in the world in different ways—always picking out objects that are really there and properties and relations that are really there. But since different languages may have different ontologies built in, there is no guarantee that any two languages will, in general, be commensurable.

 The relativistic version of the objectivist account of meaning thus claims that meaning and truth conditions are objectively given, not in universal terms, but only relative to a given language. This relativistic objectivism still holds to the myth of objectivism in claiming that truth is objective and that there are objects in the world with inherent properties. But, according to relativistic objectivism, truths expressible in one language may not be translatable into another, since each language may carve up the world in different ways. But whatever entities the language picks out exist in the world objectively as entities. Truth and meaning are still objective in this account (though relative to a given language), and human understanding is still ruled out as irrelevant to meaning and truth.

 Linguistic Expressions Are Objects: The Premise of Objectivist Linguistics

 According to the myth of objectivism, objects have properties in and of themselves and they stand in relationships to one another independently of any being who understands them. When words and sentences are written down, they can be readily looked upon as objects. This has been the premise of objectivist linguistics from its origins in antiquity to the present: Linguistic expressions are objects that have properties in and of themselves and stand in fixed relationships to one another, independently of any person who speaks them or understands them. As objects, they have parts—they are made up of building blocks: words are made up of roots, prefixes, suffixes, infixes; sentences are made up of words and phrases; discourses are made up of sentences. Within a language, the parts can stand in various relationships to one another, depending upon their building\-block structure and their inherent properties. The study of the building\-block structure, the inherent properties of the parts, and the relationships among them has traditionally been called grammar.

 Objectivist linguistics sees itself as the only scientific approach to linguistics. The objects must be capable of being analyzed in and of themselves, independently of contexts or the way people understand them. As in objectivist philosophy, there are both empiricist and rationalist traditions in linguistics. The empiricist tradition, represented by the latter\-day American structuralism of Bloomfield, Harris, and their followers, took texts as the only objects of scientific study. The rationalist tradition, represented by European structuralists such as Jakobson and American figures like Sapir, Whorf, and Chomsky, viewed language as having mental reality, with linguistic expressions as mentally real objects.

 Grammar Is Independent of Meaning and Understanding

 We have just seen how the myth of objectivism gives rise to a view of language in which linguistic expressions are objects with inherent properties, a building\-block structure, and fixed relationships among the objects. According to the myth of objectivism, the linguistic objects that exist—and their building\-block structure, their properties, and their relations—are independent of the way people understand them. It follows from this view of linguistic expressions as objects that grammar can be studied independently of meaning or human understanding.

 This tradition is epitomized by the linguistics of Noam Chomsky, who has steadfastly maintained that grammar is a matter of pure form, independent of meaning or human understanding. Any aspect of language that involves human understanding is for Chomsky by definition outside the study of grammar in this sense. Chomsky's use of the term "competence" as opposed to "performance" is an attempt to define certain aspects of language as the only legitimate objects of what he considers scientific linguistics—that is, what we have called objectivist linguistics in the rationalist mode, including only matters of pure form and excluding all matters of human understanding and language use. Though Chomsky sees linguistics as a branch of psychology, it is for him an independent branch, one that is in no way dependent on the way people actually understand language.

 The Objectivist Theory of Communication: A Version of the CONDUIT Metaphor

 Within objectivist linguistics and philosophy, meanings and linguistic expressions are independently existing objects. Such a view gives rise to a theory of communication that fits the CONDUIT metaphor very closely:

 
> Meanings are objects.
> 
>  Linguistic expressions are objects.
> 
>  Linguistic expressions have meanings (in them).
> 
>  In communication, a speaker sends a fixed meaning to a hearer via the linguistic expression associated with that meaning.

 On this account it is possible to objectively say what you mean, and communication failures are matters of subjective errors: since the meanings are objectively right there in the words, either you didn't use the right words to say what you meant or you were misunderstood.

 What an Objectivist Account of Understanding Would Be Like

 We have already given an account of what the objectivist means by understanding the literal objective meaning of a sentence, namely, understanding the conditions under which a sentence would be objectively true or false. Objectivists recognize, however, that a person may understand a sentence in a given context as meaning something other than its literal objective meaning. This other meaning is usually called the "speaker's meaning" or the "utterer's meaning, " and objectivists typically recognize that any full account of understanding will have to account for these cases, too (see Grice 1957\).

 Take, for example, the sentence "He's a real genius, " uttered in a context where sarcasm is clearly indicated. On the objectivist account, there is an objective meaning of the sentence "He's a real genius, " namely, that he has great intellectual powers. But in uttering the sentence sarcastically, the speaker intends to convey the opposite meaning, namely, that he's an utter idiot. The speaker's meaning here is the opposite of the objective meaning of the sentence.

 This account of speaker's meaning could be represented, in the appropriate sarcastic context, as follows:

 
> (A)In uttering a sentence S (S \= "He's a real genius"), which has the objective meaning M (M \= he has great intellectual powers), the speaker intends to convey to the hearer objective meaning M' (M' \= he's a real idiot).

 This is how meaning to someone might be accounted for in an objectivist framework. Sentence (A) is something that could be objectively true or false in a given context. If (A) is true, then the sentence S ("He's a real genius") can mean he's a real idiot to both the speaker and the hearer if the hearer recognizes the speaker's intentions.

 This technique, which originated with the speech\-act theorists, has been adapted to the objectivist tradition as a way of getting meaning to someone out of the objective meaning of the sentence, that is, out of its conditions for objective truth or falsity. The technical trick here involves using two objective meanings, M and M', together with sentence (A), which also has an objective meaning, in such a way as to get an account of speaker's meaning and hearer's meaning, that is, meaning to someone. This, of course, involves recognizing a speaker's intentions as being objectively real, which some objectivists might deny.

 The example we have given is one of sarcasm, where M and M' have opposite meanings, that is, opposite truth conditions. Speaking literally would be a case where M \= M'. The objectivist program sees this as a general technique for accounting for all cases of meaning to a person, especially where a speaker says one thing and means something else: exaggeration, understatement, hints, irony, and all figurative language—in particular, metaphor. Carrying out the program would involve formulating general principles that would answer the following question:

 
> Given sentence S and its literal objective meaning M, and given the relevant knowledge of the context, what specific principles allow us to predict what the speaker's meaning M' will be in this context?

 In particular, this applies in the case of metaphor. For example, "This theory is made of cheap stucco" would, on the objectivist account, have a literal objective meaning (M) which is false, namely, this theory is made of inexpensive mortar. The literal objective meaning is false because theories are not the kind of thing that can be made up of mortar at all. However, "This theory is made of cheap stucco" could have an intended speaker's meaning (M') which might be true, namely, this theory is weak. In this case, the problem would be to give general principles of interpretation by which a hearer could move from the sentence S ("This theory is made of cheap stucco") to the intended speaker's meaning M (this theory is weak) via the objective meaning M (this theory is made of inexpensive mortar).

 The objectivist sees all metaphors as cases of indirect meaning, where M \=/\= M'. All sentences containing metaphors have objective meanings that are, in the typical case, either blatantly false (e. g., "The theory is made of cheap stucco") or blatantly true (e. g., "Mussolini was an animal"). Understanding a sentence (e. g., "The theory is made of cheap stucco") as metaphorical always involves understanding it indirectly as conveying an objective meaning M' (the theory is weak) which is different from the literal objective meaning M (the theory is made of inexpensive mortar).

 The objectivist account of understanding is thus always based on its account of objective truth. It includes two kinds of understanding, direct and indirect. Direct understanding is understanding a literal objective meaning of a sentence in terms of the conditions under which it can be objectively true Indirect understanding involves figuring out when the speaker is using one sentence to convey an indirect meaning, where the conveyed meaning can be understood directly in terms of objective truth conditions.

 There are four automatic consequences of the objectivist account of metaphor:

 
> By definition, there can be no such thing as a metaphorical concept or metaphorical meaning. Meanings are objective and specify conditions of objective truth. They are by definition ways of characterizing the world as it is or might be. Conditions of objective truth simply do not provide ways of viewing one thing in terms of another. Hence, objective meanings cannot be metaphorical.
> 
>  Since metaphor cannot be a matter of meaning, it can only be a matter of language. A metaphor, on the objectivist view, can at best give us an indirect way of talking about some objective meaning M' by using the language that would be used literally to talk about some other objective meaning M, which is usually false in a blatant way.
> 
>  Again by definition, there can be no such thing as literal (conventional) metaphor. A sentence is used literally when M' \= M, that is, when the speaker's meaning is the objective meaning. Metaphors can only arise when M' \=/\=M. Thus, according to the objectivist definition, a literal metaphor is a contradiction in terms, and literal language cannot be metaphorical.
> 
>  Metaphor can contribute to understanding only by making us see objective similarities, that is, similarities between the objective meanings M and M'. These similarities must be based on shared inherent properties of objects—properties that the objects really have, in and of themselves.

 Thus, the objectivist account of meaning is completely at odds with everything we have claimed in this book. This view of meaning and of metaphor has been with us since the time of the Greeks. It fits the CONDUIT metaphor ("The meaning is right there in the words") and it fits the myth of objectivism.

 How Metaphor Reveals the Limitations of the Myth of Objectivism

 The heart of the objectivist tradition in philosophy comes directly out of the myth of objectivism: the world is made up of distinct objects, with inherent properties and fixed relations among them at any instant. We argue, on the basis of linguistic evidence (especially metaphor), that the objectivist philosophy fails to account for the way we understand our experience, our thoughts, and our language. An adequate account, we argue, requires

 
> —viewing objects only as entities relative to our interactions with the world and our projections on it
> 
>  —viewing properties as interactional rather than inherent
> 
>  —viewing categories as experiential gestalts defined via prototype instead of viewing them as rigidly fixed and defined via set theory

 We view issues having to do with meaning in natural language and with the way people understand both their language and their experiences as empirical issues rather than matters of a priori philosophical assumptions and argumentation. We have selected metaphor and the way we understand it from among the possible domains of evidence that could bear on these issues. We have focused on metaphor for the following four reasons:

 In the objectivist tradition, metaphor is of marginal interest at best, and it is excluded altogether from the study of semantics (objective meaning). It is seen as only marginally relevant to an account of truth.

 Yet we have found that metaphor is pervasive, not merely in our language but in our conceptual system. It seems inconceivable to us that any phenomenon so fundamental to our conceptual system could not be central to an account of truth and meaning.

 We observed that metaphor is one of the most basic mechanisms we have for understanding our experience. This did not jibe with the objectivist view that metaphor is of only peripheral interest in an account of meaning and truth and that it plays at best a marginal role in understanding.

 We found that metaphor could create new meaning, create similarities, and thereby define a new reality. Such a view has no place in the standard objectivist picture of the world.

 The Objectivist Account of Conventional Metaphor

 Many of the facts that we have discussed have long been known in the objectivist tradition, but they have been given an entirely different interpretation from ours.

 The conventional metaphorical concepts we take as structuring our everyday conceptual system are taken by the objectivists to be nonexistent. Metaphors, for them, are matters of mere language; there are no such things as metaphorical concepts.

 Words and expressions that we have taken as instances of metaphorical concepts (e. g., digest in "I can't digest all those facts") would be taken by objectivists as not being instances of live metaphor at all. For them the word digest would have two different and distinct literal (objective) meanings—digest 1 for food and digest2 for ideas. On this account, there would be two words digest which are homonyms, like the two words bank (bank of a river and bank where you put your money).

 An objectivist might grant that digest an idea was once a metaphor, but he would claim that it is no longer metaphorical. For him it is a "dead metaphor, " one that has become conventionalized and has its own literal meaning. This is to say that there are two homonymous words digest.

 The objectivist would probably grant that digest 1 and digest have similar meanings and that the similarity is the basis for the original metaphor. This, he would say, explains why the same word is used to express two different meanings; it was once a metaphor, it became a conventionalized part of the language; it died and became frozen, taking its old metaphorical meaning as a new literal meaning.

 The objectivist would observe that the similarities upon which the dead metaphor was based can in many cases still be perceived today.

 According to the objectivist account of metaphor, the original metaphor was a matter of use and speaker's meaning, not literal objective meaning. It would have to have arisen by the general speaker's meaning formula applied to this case (where digest referred only to food):

 
> In uttering a sentence S (S \= "I couldn't digest his ideas") with literal objective meaning M (M \= I couldn't transform his ideas, by chemical and muscular action in the alimentary canal, into a form my body could absorb), the speaker intends to convey to the hearer the speaker's meaning M' (M' \= I couldn't transform his ideas, by mental action, into a form my mind could absorb).

 Two things have to be true in order for this objectivist account to hold. First, the intended speaker's meaning M', referring to ideas, must be an objectively given meaning, having objective truth conditions. In other words, the following must be objectively true of the mind and ideas by virtue of their inherent properties:

 
> Ideas must, by virtue of their inherent properties, be the kind of thing that can have a form, be transformed, and be absorbed into the mind.
> 
>  The mind must, by virtue of its inherent properties, be the kind of thing that can perform mental actions, transform ideas, and absorb them into itself.

 Second, the metaphor must have been originally based on preexisting similarities between M and M'. That is, the mind and the alimentary canal must have inherent properties in common, just as ideas and food must have inherent properties in common.

 To summarize: the dead\-metaphor account of digest would claim the following:

 
> The word digest originally referred to a food concept.
> 
>  By a "live" metaphor, the word digest was transferred to a preexisting objective meaning in the realm of ideas, on the basis of preexisting objective similarities between food and ideas.
> 
>  Eventually the metaphor "died, " and the metaphorical use of digest an idea became conventional. Digest thus obtained a second literal objective meaning, the one occurring in M\\ This is seen, on the objectivist account, as a typical way of providing words for preexisting meanings that lack words to express them. All such cases would be considered homonyms.

 In general, an objectivist would have to treat all of our conventional\- metaphor data according to either the homonymy position (typically the weak version) or the abstraction position. Both of these positions depend on the existence of preexisting similarities based on inherent properties.

 What's Wrong with the Objectivist Account

 As we have just seen, the objectivist account of conventional metaphor requires either an abstraction view or a homonymy view. Moreover, the objectivist account of both conventional and nonconventional metaphor is based on preexisting inherent similarities. We have already presented detailed arguments against all of these positions. These arguments take on a special importance now. They show not only that the objectivist view of metaphor is inadequate but that the entire objectivist program is based on erroneous assumptions. To see just where the objectivist account of metaphor is inadequate, let us recall the relevant parts of our arguments against the abstraction, homonymy, and similarity views as they pertain to the objectivist account of conventional metaphor.

 The Similarity Position

 We saw in our discussion of the IDEAS ARE FOOD metaphor that, although the metaphor was based on similarities, the similarities themselves were not inherent but were based on other metaphors—in particular, THE MIND IS A CONTAINER, IDEAS ARE OBJECTS, and the CONDUIT metaphors. The view that IDEAS ARE OBJECTS is a projection of entity status upon mental phenomena via an ontological metaphor. The view that THE MIND IS A CONTAINER is a projection of entity status with in\-out orientation onto our cognitive faculty. These are not inherent objective properties of ideas and of the mind. They are interactional properties, and they reflect the way in which we conceive of mental phenomena by virtue of metaphor.

 The same holds in the case of our concepts TIME and LOVE. We understand sentences like "The time for action has arrived" and "We need to budget our time" in terms of the TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT and TIME IS MONEY metaphors, respectively. But on the objectivist account there would be no such metaphors. Arrive and budget in these sentences would be dead metaphors, that is, homonyms, deriving historically from once\-live metaphors. These once\-live metaphors would have to have been based on inherent similarities between time and moving objects, on the one hand, and time and money, on the other. But, as we have seen, such similarities are not inherent; they are themselves created via ontological metaphors.

 It is even more difficult to make a case for an inherentsimilarity analysis for expressions involving the concept LOVE, such as "This relationship isn't going anywhere, " "There was a magnetism between us, " and "This relationship is dying. " The concept LOVE is not inherently well defined. Our culture gives us conventional ways of viewing love experiences via conventional metaphors, such as LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE, etc., and our language reflects these. But according to the objectivist account (based either on dead metaphor, weak homonymy, or abstraction), the concept LOVE must be sufficiently well defined in terms of inherent properties to bear inherent similarities to journeys, electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena, sick people, etc. Here the objectivist must not only bear the burden of claiming that love has inherent properties similar to the inherent properties of journeys, electromagnetic phenomena, and sick people; he must also claim that love is sufficiently clearly defined in terms of these inherent properties so that those similarities will exist.

 In summary, the usual objectivist accounts of these phenomena (dead metaphor, homonymy with similarities, or abstraction) all depend on preexisting similarities based on inherent properties. In general, similarities do exist, but they cannot be based on inherent properties. The similarities arise as a result of conceptual metaphors and thus must be considered similarities of interactional, rather than inherent, properties. But the admission of interactional properties is inconsistent with the basic premise of objectivist philosophy. It amounts to giving up the myth of objectivism.

 The Objectivist Default: "It's Not Our Job"

 The only remaining alternative for the objectivist is to give up any account of any relationship between the FOOD and IDEA senses of digest in terms of similarity (including denial that there was ever a metaphor at all) and to turn to the strong homonymy position. According to this view there is one word digest with two entirely different and unrelated meanings—as different as the two meanings of punt a kick in football and an open, flat\-bottomed boat with square ends). As we have seen (in chapter 18\), the strong homonymy position cannot account for:

 Internal systematicity

 External systematicity

 Extensions of the used portion of the metaphor

 
> The use of concrete experience to structure abstract experience
> 
>  The similarities that we, in fact, see between the two senses of digest, based on metaphorically conceptualizing ideas in terms of food.

 Of course, an objectivist philosopher or linguist could grant that he cannot adequately account for such systematicities, similarities, and ways of understanding the less concrete in terms of the more concrete. This might not disturb him in the slightest. After all, he could claim, accounting for such things is not his job. Such things are matters for the psychologist, the neurophysiologist, the philologist, or someone else. This would be in the tradition of Frege's separating off "sense" from "ideas" and Lewis's separating off "abstract semantic systems" from "psychological and sociological facts. " The homonymy view, they could claim, is adequate for their proper purposes as objectivists, namely, to provide objective truth conditions for linguistic expressions and to give an account of literal objective meaning in terms of them. This, they assume, could be done independently for the two senses of digest without having to account for systematicity, similarity, understanding, etc. Relative to this conception of their job, conventional metaphorical uses of digest involve merely homonyms and not metaphors at all, dead or alive. The only metaphors they recognize are nonconventional metaphors (e. g., "Your ideas are made of cheap stucco" or "Love is a collaborative work of art"). Since these, they would claim, are matters of speaker's meaning, not the literal objective meaning of a sentence, issues of truth and meaning arising from them are to be handled by the account of speaker's meaning given above.

 In summary, the only internally consistent objectivist view of conventional metaphor would be that the issues we have been primarily concerned with—the properties of conventional metaphors and the way we use them in understanding—are simply outside their purview. They would insist that they are not responsible for such matters and that no facts of this sort concerning conventional metaphor could possibly have any bearing on the objectivist program or on what they, as objectivists, believe.

 Such objectivists might even grant that our investigations of metaphor correctly show that interactional properties and experiential gestalts are, in fact, necessary to account for how human beings understand their experience via metaphor. But even granting this, they could still continue to ignore everything we have done on the following grounds: they could say simply that experientialists are merely concerned with how human beings happen to understand reality, given all of their limitations, whereas the objectivist is concerned not with how people understand something as being true but rather with what it means for something to actually be true.

 This objectivist response perfectly highlights the fundamental difference between objectivism and experientialism. Such an objectivist reply boils down to a reaffirmation of their fundamental concern with "absolute truth" and "objective meaning, " entirely independent of anything having to do with human functioning or understanding. Against this, we have been maintaining that there is no reason to believe that there is any absolute truth or objective meaning. Instead, we maintain that it is possible to give an account of truth and meaning only relative to the way people function in the world and understand it. We are simply in a different philosophical universe from such objectivists.

 The Irrelevance of Objectivist Philosophy to Human Concerns

 We are in the same philosophical universe as, and have real disagreements with, those objectivists who think that there can be an adequate objectivist account of human understanding, of our conceptual system and our natural language. We have argued in detail that conventional metaphor is pervasive in human language and the human conceptual system and that it is a primary vehicle for understanding. We have argued that an adequate account of understanding requires interactional properties and experiential gestalts. Since all objectivist accounts require inherent properties and most of them require a set\-theoretical account of categorization, they fail to give an adequate account of how human beings conceptualize the world.

 Objectivist Models Outside of Objectivist Philosophy

 Classical mathematics comprises an objectivist universe. It has entities that are clearly distinguished from one another, e.g., numbers. Mathematical entities have inherent properties, e.g., three is odd. And there are fixed relationships among those entities, e.g., nine is the square of three. Mathematical logic was developed as part of the enterprise of providing foundations for classical mathematics. Formal semantics also developed out of that enterprise. The models used in formal semantics are examples of what we will call "objectivist models"—models appropriate to universes of discourse where there are distinct entities which have inherent properties and where there are fixed relationships among the entities.

 But the real world is not an objectivist universe, especially those aspects of the real world having to do with human beings: human experience, human institutions, human language, the human conceptual system. What it means to be a hard\-core objectivist is to claim that there is an objectivist model that fits the world as it really is. We have just argued that objectivist philosophy is empirically incorrect in that it makes false predictions about language, truth, understanding, and the human conceptual system. On the basis of this we have claimed that objectivist philosophy provides an inadequate basis for the human sciences. Nonetheless, a lot of remarkably insightful mathematicians, logicians, linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists have designed objectivist models for use in the human sciences. Are we claiming that all of this work is worthless and that objectivist models have no place at all in the human sciences?

 We are claiming no such thing. We believe that objectivist models as mathematical entities do not necessarily have to be tied to objectivist philosophy. One can believe that objectivist models can have a function—even an important function—in the human sciences without adopting the objectivist premise that there is an objectivist model that completely and accurately fits the world as it really is. But if we reject this premise, what role is left for objectivist models?

 Before we can answer this question, we need to look at some of the properties of ontological and structural metaphors:

 
> Ontological metaphors are among the most basic devices we have for comprehending our experience. Each structural metaphor has a consistent set of ontological metaphors as subparts. To use a set of ontological metaphors to comprehend a given situation is to impose an entity structure upon that situation. For example, LOVE IS A JOURNEY imposes on LOVE an entity structure including a beginning, a destination, a path, the distance you are along the path, and so on.
> 
>  Each individual structural metaphor is internally consistent and imposes a consistent structure on the concept it structures. For example, the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor imposes an internally consistent war structure on the concept ARGUMENT. When we understand love only in terms of the LOVE IS A JOURNEY metaphor, we are imposing an internally consistent JOURNEY structure on the concept LOVE.
> 
>  Although different metaphors for the same concept are not in general consistent with each other, it is possible to find sets of metaphors that are consistent with each other. Let us call these consistent sets of metaphors.
> 
>  Because each individual metaphor is internally consistent, each consistent set of metaphors allows us to comprehend a situation in terms of a well\- defined entity structure with consistent relations between the entities.
> 
>  The way that a consistent set of metaphors imposes an entity structure with a set of relations between the entities can be represented by an objectivist model. In the model, the entities are those imposed by the ontological metaphors, and the relations between the entities are those given by the internal structures of the structural metaphors.

 To summarize: Trying to structure a situation in terms of such a consistent set of metaphors is in part like trying to structure that situation in terms of an objectivist model. What is left out are the experiential bases of the metaphors and what the metaphors hide.

 The natural question to ask, then, is whether people actually think and act in terms of consistent sets of metaphors. A special case where they do is in the formulation of scientific theories, say, in biology, psychology, or linguistics. Formal scientific theories are attempts to consistently extend a set of ontological and structural metaphors. But in addition to scientific theorizing, we feel that people do try to think and act in terms of consistent sets of metaphors in a wide variety of situations. These are cases where people might be viewed as trying to apply objectivist models to their experience.

 There is an excellent reason for people to try to view a life situation in terms of an objectivist model, that is, in terms of a consistent set of metaphors. The reason is, simply, that if we can do this, we can draw inferences about the situation that will not conflict with one another. That is, we will be able to infer nonconflicting expectations and suggestions for behavior. And it is comforting—extremely comforting—to have a consistent view of the world, a clear set of expectations and no conflicts about what you should do. Objectivist models have a real appeal—and for the most human of reasons.

 We do not wish to belittle this appeal It is the same as the appeal of finding coherence in your life or in some range of life experiences. Having a basis for expectation and action is important for survival. But it is one thing to impose a single objectivist model in some restricted situations and to function in terms of that model—perhaps successfully; it is another to conclude that the model is an accurate reflection of reality. There is a good reason why our conceptual systems have inconsistent metaphors for a single concept. The reason is that there is no one metaphor that will do. Each one gives a certain comprehension of one aspect of the concept and hides others. To operate only in terms of a consistent set of metaphors is to hide many aspects of reality. Successful functioning in our daily lives seems to require a constant shifting of metaphors. The use of many metaphors that are inconsistent with one another seems necessary for us if we are to comprehend the details of our daily existence.

 One obvious utility for the study of formal objectivist models in the human sciences is that they can allow us to understand, in part, the ability to reason and function in terms of a consistent set of metaphors. This is a common activity and an important one to understand. It can also allow us to see what can be wrong with imposing a requirement of consistency—to see that any consistent set of metaphors will most likely hide indefinitely many aspects of reality—aspects that can be highlighted only by other metaphors that are inconsistent with it.

 One obvious limitation of formal models is that, so far as we can imagine, they provide no means for including the experiential basis for a metaphor and therefore provide no way of accounting for the way in which metaphorical concepts permit us to comprehend our experience. There is a corollary of this that has to do with the issue of whether a computer could ever understand things the way people do. The answer we give is no—simply because understanding requires experience, and computers don't have bodies and don't have human experiences.

 However, the study of computational models might nevertheless tell us a great deal about human intellectual capacities, especially in the areas where people reason and function partly in terms of objectivist models. Moreover, current formal techniques in computer science show promise of providing representations of inconsistent sets of metaphors. This could conceivably lead to insights about the way that people reason and function in terms of coherent, but inconsistent, metaphorical concepts. The limits of formal study seem to be in the area of the experiential bases of our conceptual system.

 Summary

 Our general conclusion is that the objectivist program is unable to give a satisfactory account of human understanding and of any issues requiring such an account. Among these issues are:

 
> —the human conceptual system and the nature of human rationality
> 
>  —human language and communication
> 
>  —the human sciences, especially psychology, anthropology, sociology, and linguistics —moral and aesthetic value
> 
>  —scientific understanding, via the human conceptual system
> 
>  —any way in which the foundations of mathematics have a basis in human understanding

 The basic elements of an experientialist account of understanding—interactional properties, experiential gestalts, and metaphorical concepts—seem to be necessary for any adequate treatment of these human issues.

 Some Inadequacies of the Myth of Subjectivism

 In Western culture, the chief alternative to objectivism has traditionally been taken to be subjectivism. We have argued that the myth of objectivism is inadequate to account for human understanding, human language, human values, human social and cultural institutions, and everything dealt with by the human sciences. Thus, according to the dichotomy that our culture would foist upon us, we would be left only with a radical subjectivity, which denies the possibility of any scientific "lawlike" account of human realities.

 But we have claimed that subjectivism is not the only alternative to objectivism, and we have been offering a third choice: the experientialist myth, which we see as making possible an adequate philosophical and methodological basis for the human sciences. We have already distinguished this alternative from the objectivist program, and it is equally important to distinguish it from a subjectivist program.

 Let us consider briefly some subjectivist positions on how people understand their experience and their language. These flow mainly from the Romantic tradition and are to be found in contemporary interpretations (probably misinterpretations) of recent Continental philosophy, especially the traditions of phenomenology and existentialism. Such subjectivist interpretations are largely popularizations that pick and choose elements of antiobjectivist Continental philosophy, often ignoring what makes certain trends in Continental thought serious attempts to provide a basis for the human sciences. These subjectivist positions, listed below, might be characterized jointly as "café phenomenology. " They include:

 
> Meaning is private: Meaning is always a matter of what is meaningful and significant to a person. What an individual finds significant and what it means to him are matters of intuition, imagination, feeling, and individual experience. What something means to one individual can never be fully known or communicated to anyone else.
> 
>  Experience is purely holistic: There is no natural structuring to our experience. Any structure that we or others place on our experience is completely artificial.
> 
>  Meanings have no natural structure: Meaning to an individual is a matter of his private feelings, experiences, intuitions, and values. These are purely holistic; they have no natural structure. Thus, meanings have no natural structure.
> 
>  Context is unstructured: The context needed for understanding an utterance—the physical, cultural, personal, and interpersonal context—has no natural structure.
> 
>  Meaning cannot be naturally or adequately represented: This is a consequence of the facts that meanings have no natural structure, that they can never be fully known or communicated to another person, and that the context needed to understand them is unstructured.

 These subjectivist positions all hinge on one basic assumption, namely, that experience has no natural structure and that, therefore, there can be no natural external constraints upon meaning and truth. Our reply follows directly from our account of how our conceptual system is grounded. We have argued that our experience is structured holistically in terms of experiential gestalts. These gestalts have structure that is not arbitrary. Instead, the dimensions that characterize the structure of the gestalts emerge naturally from our experience.

 This is not to deny the possibility that what something means to me may be based on kinds of experiences that I have had and you have not had and that, therefore, I will not be able to fully and adequately communicate that meaning to you. However, metaphor provides a way of partially communicating unshared experiences, and it is the natural structure of our experience that makes this possible.

 The Experientialist Alternative: Giving New Meaning to the Old Myths

 The fact that the myths of subjectivism and objectivism have stood for so long in Western culture indicates that each serves some important function. Each myth is motivated by real and reasonable concerns, and each has some grounding in our cultural experience.

 What Experientialism Preserves of the Concerns That Motivate Objectivism

 The fundamental concern of the myth of objectivism is the world external to the individual. The myth rightly emphasizes the fact that there are real things, existing independently of us, which constrain both how we interact with them and how we comprehend them. Objectivism's focus on truth and factual knowledge is based on the importance of such knowledge for successful functioning in our physical and cultural environment. The myth is also motivated by a concern for fairness and impartiality in cases where that matters and can be achieved in some reasonable fashion.

 The experientialist myth, as we have been sketching it, shares all these concerns. Experientialism departs from objectivism, however, on two fundamental issues:

 
> Is there an absolute truth?
> 
>  Is absolute truth necessary to meet the above concerns—the concern with knowledge that allows us to function successfully and the concern with fairness and impartiality?

 Experientialism answers no to both questions. Truth is always relative to understanding, which is based on a nonuniversal conceptual system. But this does not preclude satisfying the legitimate concerns about knowledge and impartiality that have motivated the myth of objectivism for centuries. Objectivity is still possible, but it takes on a new meaning. Objectivity still involves rising above individual bias, whether in matters of knowledge or value. But where objectivity is reasonable, it does not require an absolute, universally valid point of view. Being objective is always relative to a conceptual system and a set of cultural values. Reasonable objectivity may be impossible when there are conflicting conceptual systems or conflicting cultural values, and it is important to be able to admit this and to recognize when it occurs.

 According to the experientialist myth, scientific knowledge is still possible. But giving up the claim to absolute truth could make scientific practice more responsible, since there would be a general awareness that a scientific theory may hide as much as it highlights. A general realization that science does not yield absolute truth would no doubt change the power and prestige of the scientific community as well as the funding practices of the federal government. The result would be a more reasonable assessment of what scientific knowledge is and what its limitations are.

 What Experientialism Preserves of the Concerns That Motivate Subjectivism

 What legitimately motivates subjectivism is the awareness that meaning is always meaning to a person. What's meaningful to me is a matter of what has significance for me. And what is significant for me will not depend on my rational knowledge alone but on my past experiences, values, feelings, and intuitive insights. Meaning is not cut and dried; it is a matter of imagination and a matter of constructing coherence. The objectivist emphasis on achieving a universally valid point of view misses what is important, insightful, and coherent for the individual.

 The experientialist myth agrees that understanding does involve all of these elements. Its emphasis on interaction and interactional properties shows how meaning always is meaning to a person. And its emphasis on the construction of coherence via experiential gestalts provides an account of what it means for something to be significant to an individual. Moreover, it gives an account of how understanding uses the primary resources of the imagination via metaphor and how it is possible to give experience new meaning and to create new realities.

 Where experientialism diverges from subjectivism is in its rejection of the Romantic idea that imaginative understanding is completely unconstrained.

 In summary, we see the experientialist myth as capable of satisfying the real and reasonable concerns that have motivated the myths of both subjectivism and objectivism but without either the objectivist obsession with absolute truth or the subjectivist insistence that imagination is totally unrestricted.

 Understanding

 We see a single human motivation behind the myths of both objectivism and subjectivism, namely, a concern for understanding. The myth of objectivism reflects the human need to understand the external world in order to be able to function successfully in it. The myth of subjectivism is focused on internal aspects of understanding—what the individual finds meaningful and what makes his life worth living. The experientialist myth suggests that these are not opposing concerns. It offers a perspective from which both concerns can be met at once.

 The old myths share a common perspective: man as separate from his environment. Within the myth of objectivism, the concern for truth grows out of a concern for successful functioning. Given a view of man as separate from his environment, successful functioning is conceived of as mastery over the environment. Hence, the objectivist metaphors KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and SCIENCE PROVIDES CONTROL OVER NATURE.

 The principal theme of the myth of subjectivism is the attempt to overcome the alienation that results from viewing man as separate from his environment and from other men. This involves an embracing of the self—of individuality and reliance upon personal feelings, intuition, and values. The Romanticist version involves reveling in the senses and the feelings and attempting to gain union with nature through passive appreciation of it.

 The experientialist myth takes the perspective of man as part of his environment, not as separate from it. It focuses on constant interaction with the physical environment and with other people. It views this interaction with the environment as involving mutual change. You cannot function within the environment without changing it or being changed by it.

 Within the experientialist myth, understanding emerges from interaction, from constant negotiation with the environment and other people. It emerges in the following way: the nature of our bodies and our physical and cultural environment imposes a structure on our experience, in terms of natural dimensions of the sort we have discussed. Recurrent experience leads to the formation of categories, which are experiential gestalts with those natural dimensions. Such gestalts define coherence in our experience. We understand our experience directly when we see it as being structured coherently in terms of gestalts that have emerged directly from interaction with and in our environment. We understand experience metaphorically when we use a gestalt from one domain of experience to structure experience in another domain.

 From the experientialist perspective, truth depends on understanding, which emerges from functioning in the world. It is through such understanding that the experientialist alternative meets the objectivist's need for an account of truth. It is through the coherent structuring of experience that the experientialist alternative satisfies the subjectivist's need for personal meaning and significance.

 But experientialism provides more than just a synthesis that meets the motivating concerns of objectivism and subjectivism. The experientialist account of understanding provides a richer perspective on some of the most important areas of experience in our everyday lives:

 Interpersonal communication and mutual understanding

 Self\-understanding

 Ritual

 Aesthetic experience

 Politics

 We feel that objectivism and subjectivism both provide impoverished views of all of these areas because each misses the motivating concerns of the other. What they both miss in all of these areas is an interactionally based and creative understanding. Let us turn to an experientialist account of the nature of understanding in each of these areas.

 Interpersonal Communication and Mutual Understanding

 When people who are talking don't share the same culture, knowledge, values, and assumptions, mutual understanding can be especially difficult. Such understanding is possible through the negotiation of meaning. To negotiate meaning with someone, you have to become aware of and respect both the differences in your backgrounds and when these differences are important. You need enough diversity of cultural and personal experience to be aware that divergent world views exist and what they might be like. You also need patience, a certain flexibility in world view, and a generous tolerance for mistakes, as well as a talent for finding the right metaphor to communicate the relevant parts of unshared experiences or to highlight the shared experiences while deemphasizing the others. Metaphorical imagination is a crucial skill in creating rapport and in communicating the nature of unshared experience. This skill consists, in large measure, of the ability to bend your world view and adjust the way you categorize your experience. Problems of mutual understanding are not exotic; they arise in all extended conversations where understanding is important.

 When it really counts, meaning is almost never communicated according to the CONDUIT metaphor, that is, where one person transmits a fixed, clear proposition to another by means of expressions in a common language, where both parties have all the relevant common knowledge, assumptions, values, etc. When the chips are down, meaning is negotiated: you slowly figure out what you have in common,what it is safe to talk about, how you can communicate unshared experience or create a shared vision. With enough flexibility in bending your world view and with luck and skill and charity, you may achieve some mutual understanding.

 Communication theories based on the CONDUIT metaphor turn from the pathetic to the evil when they are applied indiscriminately on a large scale, say, in government surveillance or computerized files. There, what is most crucial for real understanding is almost never included, and it is assumed that the words in the file have meaning in themselves—disembodied, objective, understandable meaning. When a society lives by the CONDUIT metaphor on a large scale, misunderstanding, persecution, and much worse are the likely products.

 Self\-understanding

 The capacity for self\-understanding presupposes the capacity for mutual understanding. Common sense tells us that it's easier to understand ourselves than to understand other people. After all, we tend to think that we have direct access to our own feelings and ideas and not to anybody else's. Self\- understanding seems prior to mutual understanding, and in some ways it is. But any really deep understanding of why we do what we do, feel what we feel, change as we change, and even believe what we believe, takes us beyond ourselves. Understanding of ourselves is not unlike other forms of understanding—it comes out of our constant interactions with our physical, cultural, and interpersonal environment. At a minimum, the skills required for mutual understanding are necessary even to approach self\-understanding. Just as in mutual understanding we constantly search out commonalities of experience when we speak with other people, so in self\-understanding we are always searching for what unifies our own diverse experiences in order to give coherence to our lives. Just as we seek out metaphors to highlight and make coherent what we have in common with someone else, so we seek out personal metaphors to highlight and make coherent our own pasts, our present activities, and our dreams, hopes, and goals as well. A large part of self\- understanding is the search for appropriate personal metaphors that make sense of our lives. Self\-understanding requires unending negotiation and renegotiation of the meaning of your experiences to yourself. In therapy, for example, much of self\-understanding involves consciously recognizing previously unconscious metaphors and how we live by them. It involves the constant construction of new coherences in your life, coherences that give new meaning to old experiences. The process of self\-understanding is the continual development of new life stories for yourself.

 The experientialist approach to the process of self\-understanding involves:

 
> Developing an awareness of the metaphors we live by and an awareness of where they enter into our everyday lives and where they do not
> 
>  Having experiences that can form the basis of alternative metaphors
> 
>  Developing an "experiential flexibility"
> 
>  Engaging in an unending process of viewing your life through new alternative metaphors

 Ritual

 We are constantly performing rituals, from casual rituals, like making the morning coffee by the same sequence of steps each day and watching the eleven o'clock news straight to the end (after we've seen it already at six o'clock); to going to football games, Thanksgiving dinners, and university lectures by distinguished visitors; and so on to the most solemn prescribed religious practices. All are repeated structured practices, some consciously designed in detail, some more consciously performed than others, and some emerging spontaneously. Each ritual is a repeated, coherently structured, and unified aspect of our experience. In performing them, we give structure and significance to our activities, minimizing chaos and disparity in our actions. In our terms, a ritual is one kind of experiential gestalt. It is a coherent sequence of actions, structured in terms of the natural dimensions of our experience. Religious rituals are typically metaphorical kinds of activities, which usually involve metonymies—real\-world objects standing for entities in the world as defined by the conceptual system of the religion. The coherent structure of the ritual is commonly taken as paralleling some aspect of reality as it is seen through the religion.

 Everyday personal rituals are also experiential gestalts consisting of sequences of actions structured along the natural dimensions of experience—a part\-whole structure, stages, causal relationships, and means of accomplishing goals. Personal rituals are thus natural kinds of activities for individuals or for members of a subculture. They may or may not be metaphorical kinds of activities. For example, it is common in Los Angeles to engage in the ritual activity of driving by the homes of Hollywood stars. This is a metaphorical kind of activity based on the metonymy THE HOME STANDS FOR THE PERSON and the metaphor PHYSICAL CLOSENESS is PERSONAL CLOSENESS. Other everyday rituals, whether metaphorical or not, provide experiential gestalts that can be the basis of metaphors, e. g., "You don't know what you're opening the door to, " "Let's roll up our sleeves and get down to work, " etc.

 We suggest that

 
> The metaphors we live by, whether cultural or personal, are partially preserved in ritual.
> 
>  Cultural metaphors, and the values entailed by them, are propagated by ritual.
> 
>  Ritual forms an indispensable part of the experiential basis for our cultural metaphorical systems. There can be no culture without ritual.

 Similarly, there can be no coherent view of the self without personal ritual (typically of the casual and spontaneously emerging sort). Just as our personal metaphors are not random but form systems coherent with our personalities, so our personal rituals are not random but are coherent with our view of the world and ourselves and with our system of personal metaphors and metonymies. Our implicit and typically unconscious conceptions of ourselves and the values that we live by are perhaps most strongly reflected in the little things we do over and over, that is, in the casual rituals that have emerged spontaneously in our daily lives.

 Aesthetic Experience

 From the experientialist perspective, metaphor is a matter of imaginative rationality. It permits an understanding of one kind of experience in terms of another, creating coherences by virtue of imposing gestalts that are structured by natural dimensions of experience. New metaphors are capable of creating new understandings and, therefore, new realities. This should be obvious in the case of poetic metaphor, where language is the medium through which new conceptual metaphors are created.

 But metaphor is not merely a matter of language. It is a matter of conceptual structure. And conceptual structure is not merely a matter of the intellect—it involves all the natural dimensions of our experience, including aspects of our sense experiences: color, shape, texture, sound, etc. These dimensions structure not only mundane experience but aesthetic experience as well. Each art medium picks out certain dimensions of our experience and excludes others. Artworks provide new ways of structuring our experience in terms of these natural dimensions. Works of art provide new experiential gestalts and, therefore, new coherences. From the experientialist point of view, art is, in general, a matter of imaginative rationality and a means of creating new realities.

 Aesthetic experience is thus not limited to the official art world. It can occur in any aspect of our everyday lives— whenever we take note of, or create for ourselves, new coherences that are not part of our conventionalized mode of perception or thought.

 Politics

 Political debate typically is concerned with issues of freedom and economics. But one can be both free and economically secure while leading a totally meaningless and empty existence. We see the metaphorical concepts of FREEDOM, EQUALITY, SAFETY, ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE, POWER, etc., as being different ways of getting indirectly at issues of meaningful existence. They are all necessary aspects of an adequate discussion of the issue, but, to our knowledge, no political ideology addresses the main issue head\-on. In fact, many ideologies argue that matters of personal or cultural meaningfulness are secondary or to be addressed later. Any such ideology is dehumanizing.

 Political and economic ideologies are framed in metaphorical terms. Like all other metaphors, political and economic metaphors can hide aspects of reality. But in the area of politics and economics, metaphors matter more, because they constrain our lives. A metaphor in a political or economic system, by virtue of what it hides, can lead to human degradation.

 Consider just one example: labor is a resource. Most contemporary economic theories, whether capitalist or socialist, treat labor as a natural resource or commodity, on a par with raw materials, and speak in the same terms of its cost and supply. What is hidden by the metaphor is the nature of the labor. No distinction is made between meaningful labor and dehumanizing labor. For all of the labor statistics, there is none on meaningful labor. When we accept the LABOR IS A RESOURCE metaphor and assume that the cost of resources defined in this way should be kept down, then cheap labor becomes a good thing, on a par with cheap oil. The exploitation of human beings through this metaphor is most obvious in countries that boast of "a virtually inexhaustible supply of cheap labor"—a neutralsounding economic statement that hides the reality of human degradation. But virtually all major industrialized nations, whether capitalist or socialist, use the same metaphor in their economic theories and policies. The blind acceptance of the metaphor can hide degrading realities, whether meaningless blue\-collar and white\-collar industrial jobs in "advanced" societies or virtual slavery around the world.

 Afterword

 Collaborating on this book has given us the opportunity to explore our ideas not only with each other but with literally hundreds of people—students and colleagues, friends, relatives, acquaintances, even strangers at the next cafe table. And after having worked out all of the consequences we could think of, for philosophy and for linguistics, what stands out most in our minds are the metaphors themselves and the insights they have given us into our own daily experiences. We still react with awe when we notice ourselves and those around us living by metaphors like TIME IS MONEY, LOVE IS A JOURNEY, and PROBLEMS ARE PUZZLES. We continually find it important to realize that the way we have been brought up to perceive our world is not the only way and that it is possible to see beyond the "truths" of our culture.

 But metaphors are not merely things to be seen beyond. In fact, one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors. It is as though the ability to comprehend experience through metaphor were a sense, like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors providing the only ways to perceive and experience much of the world. Metaphor is as much a part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as precious.

 Afterword, 2003

 This small book has contributed to the study of the human mind in ways we could not have dreamed of when we wrote it two decades ago. Our original motivation was to awaken readers throughout the world to the often beautiful, sometimes disturbing, but always profound, realities of everyday metaphorical thought.

 By bringing metaphorical thought into the limelight, this book revealed the need to rethink some of the most fundamental ideas in the study of mind: meaning, truth, the nature of thought, and the role of the body in the shaping of mind. As a result it had far\-reaching implications in field after field—not just linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy but also literary studies, politics, law, clinical psychology, religion, and even mathematics and the philosophy of science.

 How we think metaphorically matters. It can determine questions of war and peace, economic policy, and legal decisions, as well as the mundane choices of everyday life. Is a military attack a "rape, " "a threat to our security, " or "the defense of a population against terrorism"? The same attack can be conceptualized in any of these ways with very different military consequences. Is your marriage a partnership, a journey through life together, a haven from the outside world, a means for growth, or a union of two people into a third entity? The choice among such common ways of conceptualizing marriage can determine what your marriage becomes. Drastic metaphorical differences can result in marital conflict. Take for example the case where one spouse views marriage as a partnership, and the other spouse views it as a haven. The responsibilities of a partnership may well be at odds with the relief from responsibilities characteristic of a haven.

 Metaphorical thought is normal and ubiquitous in our mental life, both conscious and unconscious. The same mechanisms of metaphorical thought used throughout poetry are present in our most common concepts: time, events, causation, emotion, ethics, and business, to name but a few. Conceptual metaphors even lie behind the building of computer interfaces (e. g., the desktop metaphor) and the structuring of the Internet into "information highways, " "department stores, " "chat rooms, " "auction houses, " "amusement parks, " and so on. It is the systematicity of metaphorical thought that permits such applications.

 The heart of metaphor is inference. Conceptual metaphor allows inferences in sensory\-motor domains (e. g., domains of space and objects) to be used to draw inferences about other domains (e. g., domains of subjective judgment, with concepts like intimacy, emotions, justice, and so on). Because we reason in terms of metaphor, the metaphors we use determine a great deal about how we live our lives.

 Persistent Fallacies

 There are four major historical barriers to understanding the nature of metaphorical thought and its profundity, and these amount to four false views of metaphor. In the Western tradition, they all go back at least as far as Aristotle. The first fallacy is that metaphor is a matter of words, not concepts. The second is that metaphor is based on similarity. The third is that all concepts are literal and that none can be metaphorical. The fourth is that rational thought is in no way shaped by the nature of our brains and bodies.

 Further research subsequent to this book has established conclusively that all four views are false. First, the locus of metaphor is in concepts not words. Second, metaphor is, in general, not based on similarity, as we argued throughout this book. Instead, it is typically based on cross\-domain correlations in our experience, which give rise to the perceived similarities between the two domains within the metaphor. For example, the persistent use of a metaphor may create perceived similarities, as when a love relationship, conceived of metaphorically as a partnership, goes awry when responsibilities and benefits are not shared equally. Third, even our deepest and most abiding concepts—time, events, causation, morality, and mind itself— are understood and reasoned about via multiple metaphors. In each case, one conceptual domain (say, time) is reasoned about, as well as talked about, in terms of the conceptual structure of another domain (say, space). Fourth, the system of conceptual metaphors is not arbitrary or just historically contingent; rather, it is shaped to a significant extent by the common nature of our bodies and the shared ways that we all function in the everyday world.

 Yet, despite all the evidence for the pervasiveness of conceptual metaphor, these long\-standing, mistaken assumptions not just about metaphor but about meaning in general have persisted. These age\-old, a priori philosophical views are so deeply engrained that they blind many readers to any evidence to the contrary.

 The single biggest obstacle to understanding our findings has been the refusal to recognize the conceptual nature of metaphor. The idea that metaphors are nothing but linguistic expressions—a mere matter of words—is such a common fallacy that it has kept many readers from even entertaining the idea that we think metaphorically. The fallacy is that metaphor is only about the ways we talk and not about conceptualization and reasoning.

 Countering this view is a huge body of empirical evidence gained from many different methods of inquiry that reveals the central role of metaphor in abstract thought. It is not surprising that someone raised with the traditional view would continue to deny or ignore this evidence, since to accept it would require large\-scale revisions of the way he or she understands not only metaphor but concepts, meaning, language, knowledge, and truth as well.

 Because there is so much at stake, these fallacies about metaphor are difficult to eliminate. They have been around for over two thousand years. Yet they are wrong, that is, they are at odds with the empirical evidence. The fact that they are wrong is no small matter. It has implications for all aspects of our lives, including war and peace, the environment, health, and other political and social issues. It bears directly on how we understand our own personal lives, and it bears directly on intellectual disciplines like philosophy, mathematics, and literary studies, all of which ultimately have important cultural effects.

 Evidence for Conceptual Metaphor

 It is crucial to recognize that questions about the nature of meaning, conceptualization, reasoning, and language are questions requiring empirical study; they cannot be answered adequately by mere a priori philosophizing. The nature of metaphor also is not a matter of definition; it is a question of the nature of cognition.

 
> > Do we systematically use inference patterns from one conceptual domain to reason about another conceptual domain?

 The empirically established answer is "yes. " We call that phenomenon conceptual metaphor, and we call the systematic correspondences across such domains metaphorical mappings. This leads to a further empirical question:

 
> > Are those metaphorical mappings purely abstract and arbitrary?

 The empirical answer is "no. " They are shaped and constrained by our bodily experiences in the world, experiences in which the two conceptual domains are correlated and consequently establish mappings from one domain to another. Finally, there is a corresponding question about the nature of language:

 
> > Is all ordinary, conventionalized, everyday language literal, or can common everyday linguistic expressions be metaphorical?

 The answer is empirical: A great deal of everyday, conventional language is metaphorical, and the metaphorical meanings are given by conceptual metaphorical mappings that ultimately arise from correlations in our embodied experience.

 In short, metaphor is a natural phenomenon. Conceptual metaphor is a natural part of human thought, and linguistic metaphor is a natural part of human language. Moreover, which metaphors we have and what they mean depend on the nature of our bodies, our interactions in the physical environment, and our social and cultural practices. Every question about the nature of conceptual metaphor and its role in thought and language is an empirical question.

 What is needed is still more empirical research that seeks converging evidence and is gathered by using different empirical methods of inquiry. Multiple methods of inquiry, with different methodological assumptions, have been used effectively to date. This has allowed researchers to avoid having evidence dictated a priori by the assumptions of any one particular methodology (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 6\).

 In 1980 we had evidence for the theory of conceptual metaphor from only two areas of research:

 Systematic polysemy: In this area of research, entire lexical fields of words not only have literal meanings in a concrete domain but also have systematically related meanings in abstract domains. For example, up, down, rise, fall, high, low, hit bottom, and so on, are not only about verticality but also quantity. Thus, the conceptual metaphor More Is Up explains why we use the polysemous word rise, for example, to mean both increase in elevation and increase in quantity. The conceptual metaphor explains the systematicity of the polysemy, and correspondingly, the systematic polysemy provides evidence for the existence of the metaphor.

 Generalizations over inference patterns: A fundamental finding here is that reasoning in abstract domains uses the logic of our sensory\-motor experience. For example, if something rises physically, it is higher than it was before. If the price of something "rises" (metaphorically), then it is "higher" (metaphorically) than it was before. The metaphor More Is Up maps the inference pattern about physical heights onto the inference pattern about amounts. By hypothesizing the metaphor, we can see that these two apparently different inference patterns are in fact the same. Moreover, by hypothesizing a single More Is Up metaphor mapping verticality to quantity, we could account for both the polysemous use of words and the generalization over inferences. In other words, there were then two sources of evidence—polysemy and inference—for that conceptual metaphor.

 After twenty years of research by hundreds of investigators, vast bodies of empirical evidence for conceptual metaphor have been gathered from studies in a wide range of fields within the cognitive sciences. We initially had two primary sources of evidence—polysemy generalizations and inference generalizations. We now have at least seven other types of evidence derived from various empirical methods:

 1. extensions to poetic and novel cases (Lakoff and Turner 1989\)
2. psychological research, for example, priming studies (Gibbs 1994; Boroditzky 2000\)
3. gesture studies (McNeill 1992\)
4. historical semantic change research (Sweetser 1990\)
5. discourse analysis (Narayanan 1997\)
6. sign language analysis (Taub 1997\)
7. language acquisition (C. Johnson 1999\)

 The importance of this evidence is that it comes from many different methodologies and no longer rests exclusively on data from linguistic forms and inferences. These new sources have produced converging results concerning the way metaphor lies at the heart of abstract thought and symbolic expression.

 Developments in Metaphor Theory

 Over the years, the theory of metaphor has developed and deepened considerably. The evidence for the existence and pervasiveness of conceptual metaphor has mounted, giving us a much clearer picture of how metaphor structures thought. Initially we had only guessed that conceptual metaphors were grounded in bodily experience. In the early 1980s, Lakoff and Kövecses showed that the system of metaphors for anger arose, across languages and cultures, from the physiology of anger itself (Lakoff 1987; Kövecses 1986, 1990\).

 By the early 1990s, a whole new level of metaphor analysis was discovered that we will call deep analysis. What we and other researchers found was that our most fundamental ideas—not just time, but events, causation, morality, the self, and so on—were almost entirely structured by elaborate systems of conceptual metaphor. Even the basic concepts of causation used in the physical and social sciences are primarily constituted by a system of nearly two dozen distinct metaphors, each with its own causal logic (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 11\). Thus, causation can be conceptualized in terms of forced motion to a new location (as in, "Scientific developments have propelled us into the Digital Age"), the giving and taking of objects ("These vitamins will give you energy"), links ("Cancer has been linked to pesticide use"), motion along a path ("China is on the road to democracy, having taken the path of capitalism"), and so on. This discovery was particularly startling, even to us, because it challenged the widespread view that there is a single kind of causation with a single causal logic structuring the world.

 Deep analysis further revealed that our basic understanding of morality arises via conceptual metaphor. There is a system of approximately two dozen metaphors that arise spontaneously out of common, everyday experience in cultures around the world (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 15\). Since morality is concerned with well\-being, whether one's own or that of another, fundamental experiences concerning well\-being give rise to conceptual metaphors for morality. People are better off in general if they are strong not weak; if they can stand upright rather than having to crawl; if they eat pure, not rotten, food; and so on. These correlations give rise to metaphors of morality as strength and immorality as weakness, morality as uprightness and immorality as being low, morality as purity and immorality as rot, and so on. Since you are better off if you have the things you need rather than if you don't, there is a correlation of well\-being with wealth. Hence, there is a widespread metaphor in which moral action is conceptualized as increasing another's well\-being, which is metaphorically understood as increasing their wealth. Immoral action, therefore, is conceptualized as decreasing another's wealth. Thus, if someone does you a favor, you are in her debt and seek to repay the favor. This is the basis of the metaphor of Moral Accounting, in which morality prescribes a balancing of the moral books.

 The deep analysis of morality has important implications for politics, as shown by Lakoff's analysis of liberal and conservative worldviews on morality and politics. This analysis is based on two opposing models of the family, the nurturant parent and the strict father families (Lakoff 1996\). Under the metaphor of The Nation as a Family, these opposing family models are transformed into moral and political worldviews that are fundamentally at odds. Such worldview metaphors tend to be so deeply pervasive that they organize other metaphors into moral and political conceptual systems.

 Metaphor Composition

 In More Than Cool Reason (1989\), Lakoff and Turner applied deep analysis to metaphors in complex poetic and literary texts. The analysis revealed an anatomy of imagination: new metaphorical ideas—that is, new ways of organizing and understanding experience—arise from the combination of simpler conceptual metaphors to form complex ones. Consequently, innovation and novelty are not miraculous; they do not come out of nowhere. They are built using the tools of everyday metaphorical thought, as well as other commonplace conceptual mechanisms.

 For example, Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 uses three metaphors for a lifetime: a day, a year, and a fire. Lakoff and Turner note that these are composite metaphors made up of the following more basic metaphors: Life Is Light and Death Is Darkness, Life Is Heat and Death Is Cold, and A Lifetime Is a Cycle of Waxing and Waning. Days, years, and fires all involve a waxing and waning cycle, with light and heat during waxing and darkness and cold during waning.

 In addition, Lakoff and Turner found cases of composition involving both metaphor and metonymy. In the classic figure of the Grim Reaper, there is such a composition. The term "reaper" is based on the metaphor of People as Plants: just as a reaper cuts down wheat with a scythe before it has gone through its life cycle, so the Grim Reaper comes with his scythe indicating a premature death. The metaphor of Death as Departure is also part of the myth of the Grim Reaper. In the myth, the Reaper comes to the door and the deceased departs with him.

 The figure of the Reaper is also based on two conceptual metonymies. The Reaper takes the form of a skeleton—the form of the body after it has decayed, a form which metonymically symbolizes death. The Reaper also wears a cowl, the clothing of monks who presided over funerals at the time the figure of the Reaper became popular. Further, in the myth the Reaper is in control, presiding over the departure of the deceased from this life. Thus, the myth of the Grim Reaper is the result of two metaphors and two metonymies having been put together with precision.

 Lakoff and Turner thus showed in detail how conceptual metaphors and metonymies can fit together to form complex and novel combinations.

 Metaphors for Metaphor

 Every scientific theory is constructed by scientists—human beings who necessarily use the tools of the human mind. One of those tools is conceptual metaphor. When the scientific subject matter is metaphor itself, it should be no surprise that such an enterprise has to make use of metaphor, as it is embodied in the mind, to construct a scientific understanding of what metaphor is.

 Our first metaphor for conceptual metaphor came from mathematics. We first saw conceptual metaphors as mappings in the mathematical sense, that is, as mappings across conceptual domains. This metaphor proved useful in several respects. It was precise. It specified exact, systematic correspondences. It allowed for the use of source domain inference patterns to reason about the target domain. Finally, it allowed for partial mappings. In short, it was a good first approximation.

 However, the Mathematical Mapping metaphor proved to be inadequate in an important respect. Mathematical mappings do not create target entities, while conceptual metaphors often do. For example, time doesn't necessarily have a use and isn't necessarily a resource. Many people in cultures around the world simply live their lives without being concerned about whether they are using their time efficiently. However, other cultures conceptualize time metaphorically as though it were a limited resource. The Time Is Money metaphor imposes on the time domain various aspects of resources. In doing so, it adds elements to the time domain, creating a new understanding of time.

 In order to account for this creative aspect, it was necessary to find a more adequate metaphor for conceptual metaphor. We needed a way to think about metaphors so that they could not just be mappings but also could add elements to a domain. We accordingly adopted the Projection Metaphor, based on the image of an overhead projector. We saw a target domain as an initial slide on the projector and metaphorical projection as the process of laying another slide on top of the first one, adding the structure of the source to that of the target. This metaphor for metaphor allowed us to conceptualize the idea that metaphors add extra entities and relations to the target domain.

 The Projection metaphor also allowed us to account for another fact. Before this book, it had been discovered that images have a structure. For example, imagine someone walking into a room. The room is conceptualized as a container, and the walking as comprising a path of motion with a beginning outside the room and an ending inside. Containers and Paths are image\-schemas in the sense that they are primitives that structure rich images. We discovered that the image\-schema structure of the source domain is used in reasoning about the target domain. Moreover, by looking at hundreds of cases, we found that image\-schema structure and image\-schematic inferences seemed to be "preserved" by metaphors. That is, source domain containers (e. g., physical traps) are mapped to containers (e. g., metaphorical traps), with interiors mapped to interiors and exteriors mapped to exteriors. When a conceptual metaphor applies to a Path schema, goals are mapped to goals, origins to origins, and so on. Under the Projection metaphor, this was an immediate consequence.

 Unfortunately, the Projection metaphor introduced a major problem. According to the Projection metaphor, all of the source domain should be projected onto the target; however, some parts of the source domain are not mapped. In Theories Are Buildings, much is not mapped—the paint, the electrical wiring, and so on. According to the Conduit metaphor, I can give you an idea, but I still have it, which isn't true in the source domain of physical objects. If I give you a diamond, I no longer have it. In short, mappings tend to be partial, but the Projection metaphor doesn't allow this. Even worse, there is a systematicity about certain aspects of partial mappings. A source domain element is not mapped if it would produce an inference that would contradict the internal structure of the target. In that case, the mapping must be overridden. Thus, we needed to add to the Projection metaphor the ugly idea of target domain overrides. The unfortunate principle behind this term is "Don't map an element if it would give rise to a contradiction in the target domain. " (Lakoff 1993\)

 By 1997 the Projection metaphor was abandoned in favor of a neural theory. That theory came out of the Neural Theory of Language project directed by Jerome Feldman and George Lakoff at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley.

 Primary Metaphor and the Neural Theory

 A major advance in metaphor theory came in 1997 with fundamental insights by Joseph Grady (1997\), Christopher Johnson (1997\), and Srinivas Narayanan (1997\). We had found cases, like More Is Up, in which embodied experience in the world seemed to provide a grounding for metaphors. In More Is Up, for example, we regularly experience an increase in height correlated with an increase in quantity, as when one pours more water into a glass. What had kept us from noticing bodily grounding in its full grandeur was our major concentration on complex metaphors of the sort discussed in this book. Grady showed that complex metaphors arise from primary metaphors that are directly grounded in the everyday experience that links our sensory\-motor experience to the domain of our subjective judgments. For example, we have the primary conceptual metaphor Affection Is Warmth because our earliest experiences with affection correspond to the physical experience of the warmth of being held closely.

 Christopher Johnson has argued that children learn primary metaphors on the basis of the conflation of conceptual domains in everyday life. He studied how the Knowing Is Seeing metaphor develops, demonstrating that children first use "see" literally, that is, only about vision. Then there is a stage when seeing and knowing are conflated, when children say things like "See Daddy come in" or "See what I spilled"; seeing occurs together with knowing. Only later do clear metaphorical uses of "see" like "See what I mean" occur. These uses are about knowledge, not literal seeing.

 The results of Joseph Grady's and Christopher Johnson's research can be explained by the neural theory of metaphor developed by Srinivas Narayanan (1997\). Using computational techniques for neural modeling, Narayanan developed a theory in which conceptual metaphors are computed neurally via neural maps—neural circuitry linking the sensory\-motor system with higher cortical areas.

 The terms map and mapping used here come from neuroscience. In the visual system of the brain, neurons project, that is, extend, from the retina to the primary visual cortex (VI), with neurons that are adjacent or nearby in the retina projecting to neurons that are adjacent or nearby in VI. The neurons active in VI are said to form a map in VI of the retinal image. The metaphor here is topographic, with the retina as territory and VI as the map.

 Similarly, the motor cortex is said to contain a map of the body. Neuronal clusters throughout the body "project" (that is, are connected) to neuronal clusters in the motor cortex, with neuronal clusters adjacent or nearby on the body projecting to neuronal clusters adjacent to or nearby the corresponding clusters in the motor cortex. Maps of such types are common in the brain.

 In the neural theory of metaphor, therefore, the terms map and projection take on a whole new meaning. The maps or mappings are physical links: neural circuitry linking neuronal clusters called nodes. The domains are highly structured neural ensembles in different regions of the brain.

 The neural maps are learned via neural recruitment, the long\-term potentiation of neurons connected to the source and target neural ensembles that are coactive during Johnson's period of conflation. (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 4\. ) This neural learning mechanism produces a stable, conventional system of primary metaphors that tend to remain in place indefinitely within the conceptual system and are independent of language.

 For example, the metaphor Affection Is Warmth (as in, "He's a warm person. " or "She's a block of ice. ") arises from the common experience of a child being held affectionately by a parent; here, affection occurs together with warmth. In Johnson's terms, they are conflated. There is neuronal activation occurring simultaneously in two separate parts of the brain: those devoted to emotions and those devoted to temperature. As the saying goes in neuroscience, "Neurons that fire together wire together. " Appropriate neural connections between the brain regions are recruited. These connections physically constitute the Affection Is Warmth metaphor.

 Metaphor is a neural phenomenon. What we have referred to as metaphorical mappings appear to be realized physically as neural maps. They constitute the neural mechanism that naturally, and inevitably, recruits sensory\-motor inference for use in abstract thought. Primary metaphors arise spontaneously and automatically without our being aware of them. There are hundreds of such primary conceptual metaphors, most of them learned unconsciously and automatically in childhood simply by functioning in the everyday world with a human body and brain. There are primary metaphors for time, causation, events, morality, emotions, and other domains that are central to human thought. Such metaphors also provide a superstructure for our systems of complex metaphorical thought and language.

 You don't have a choice as to whether to think metaphorically. Because metaphorical maps are part of our brains, we will think and speak metaphorically whether we want to or not. Since the mechanism of metaphor is largely unconscious, we will think and speak metaphorically, whether we know it or not. Further, since our brains are embodied, our metaphors will reflect our commonplace experiences in the world. Inevitably, many primary metaphors are universal because everybody has basically the same kinds of bodies and brains and lives in basically the same kinds of environments, so far as the features relevant to metaphor are concerned.

 The complex metaphors that are composed of primary metaphors and that make use of culturally based conceptual frames are another matter. Because they make use of cultural information, they may differ significantly from culture to culture.

 The Neural Basis of Metaphorical Thought

 When we imagine seeing a scene, our visual cortex is active. When we imagine moving our bodies, the pre\-motor cortex and motor cortex are active. In short, some of the same parts of our brains are active in imagining as in perceiving and doing. We will use the term enactment for dynamic brain functions shared both during perceiving and acting and during imagining. An enactment, real or imaginative, is dynamic, that is, it occurs in real time.

 Our sensory\-motor concepts arise from our sensory\-motor experiences (experiences moving in space, perceiving,manipulating objects, and so on). Fixed concepts are neural information structures called neural parameterizations that can guide imaginative enactments when activated. Conceptual metaphors, at the neural level, link source domain parameterizations to target domain parameterizations. By this means we can carry out metaphorical enactments—forms of imagination in which abstract reasoning is governed by sensory\-motor enactments unfolding in real time and in real contexts.

 Multiple enactments are always being carried out by the brain, and single enactments can be guided by multiple parameterizations. Consequently, target domain enactments can be governed by multiple metaphors. This explains why there are complex metaphorical sentences like I've fallen in love, but we seem to be going in different directions. Here a number of metaphors structure the enactment: Lack of Control Is Down, as with "fall"; States Are Locations, as with "in love"; Changes Are Motions, as when falling in love is characterized as a change to a new state; and Love Is A Journey, as when lovers may be "going in different directions. " In such a specific target domain enactment, love can be understood in terms of a state (in love), in terms of issues of control (falling), and in terms of the compatibility of the life goals of the lovers (going in different directions).

 This is not at all like the old Projection Metaphor. Metaphorical inferences are typically carried out via source domain enactments. The results of source domain inferences are carried over to the target domain via neural links. The learning of new metaphors therefore involves only the establishment of new neural connections and not the creation of copies of complex, inferential machinery. No overrides are necessary. The reason is this: Metaphors are learned when two experiences occur at once. If a metaphorical link would result in a contradiction in the target domain, it will not be learned. Neurally, contradictions are mutual inhibitions. Any would\-be link that would lead to a contradiction with the inherent structure of the target domain will be inhibited; thus it will never be learned.

 Locating the theory of metaphor within the Neural Theory of Language has a number of advantages:

 
> —We gain an explanation via embodiment for how primary metaphors are learned: universal primary metaphors arise from universal primary experiences.
> 
>  —We gain an explanation for why metaphorical thought exists and why it is normal and inescapable: the regular coactivation of two domains results in the recruitment of neural circuitry linking them.
> 
>  —No theory of overrides is needed.
> 
>  —Metaphors fit naturally with the rest of the Neural Theory of Language.
> 
>  —Neural enactment provides a mechanism for characterizing the dynamic use of metaphor in context and in discourse.
> 
>  —Since the Neural Theory of Language comes with explicit computational models, there is an explicit computational account of how metaphors operate dynamically.

 Metaphor and Dynamic Enactment

 We have been concerned with metaphorical inferences since we wrote Metaphors We Live By. However, an important distinction between two types of inference has only recently been pointed out. In Narayanan's model (1997\), parameterization gives rise to what we will call structural inferences, which characterize static inferential structure. Enactment inferences arise, on the other hand, only in the unfolding of a dynamic process.

 An example of a structural inference in the domain of economics would be "Increasing the money supply without increasing production tends to increase inflation. " Such probabilistic inferences characterize the tendencies that structure a national economic system. Compare this with the kind of inference mechanism used to understand the enactment of a physical action, such as "John fell into a ditch and Harry pulled him out. " Here the detailed inferences arise as a result of imagining what happened. John went out of control in falling; he may well have gotten hurt; he couldn't get out by himself; Harry grasped his arm (or other part of his body); Harry had strength or leverage that John did not; Harry exerted force, pulling hard and perhaps injuring himself to some extent; and John gradually came up out of the ditch as Harry pulled. In his modeling of economic discourse (1997\), Narayanan took up sentences like, France fell into a recession and Germany pulled it out. Here a number of conceptual metaphors and a metonymy are at work. Metaphors: Nations Are People; Economies Are Entities That Move Forward Over Time, up or down; A Recession Is A Hole; Economic Force Is The Use Of Money. Metonymy: A Nation Stands For Its Economy. For example, "France" stands for the French economy.

 Narayanan showed that the overall inferences derive from a combination of both types of inference, those being structural inferences about international economics (target domain) and enacted inferences about falling and pulling (source domain). The enacted inferences are embodied; as such, they are carried out in the source domain. Their effects are mapped to the target domain and hence to the discourse space of international economics. The source domain (of falling and pulling) is enacted, and the inferences are mapped to the target domain of international economics. By that means, they influence the reasoning involved in the ongoing discourse about international economics—literal structural inferences and enacted metaphorical inferences mix with each other and with contextual information to give rise to new structure. That new structure does not follow from the source domain alone, the subject matter (target) domain alone, or context alone. Narayanan happened to discuss cases in which only the source domain used enacted inferences. There are other cases in which the target domain also has to be imaginatively enacted.

 These technical achievements have given us a neural theory of dynamic metaphor use in enacted discourse, one that has been computationally implemented in significant ways.

 Enactment and Blending

 The Neural Theory of Language project began in 1988 and continues today. Over roughly the same period, Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner (2002\) have developed a theory of blended spaces that, though different in scope and intent, overlaps in important ways with certain aspects of the Neural Theory of Language.

 Blending theory takes for granted all of the static, longterm conceptual structure that is used in enactment. In other words, it assumes all the structure that we call parameterizations, including metaphorical mappings from source to target domains, as well as image\-schemas, force\-dynamic schemas, frames, prototypes, metonymic mappings, and so on. Blending theory is centrally concerned with the use of all this general conceptual structure in particular examples. That is, it is concerned with conceptual integration: how conceptual structures are combined for use in particular cases, especially in imaginative cases. What is called blending or conceptual integration in blending theory seems to correspond to binding in the neural theory.

 Blending theory makes use of Fauconnier's theory of Mental Spaces, relatively small mental models of particular situations that have been structured by the concepts in our conceptual systems. A blended space is a mental space that imaginatively combines elements of at least two other mental spaces that are structured by our ordinary long\-term conceptual system.

 Here is a simple example of a blend that recently appeared on TV: a Jewish pizza. A Jewish cooking show featured Wolfgang Puck, the noted Austrian chef from LA, famous for his elegant pizzas and married to a Jewish woman. His Jewish pizza starts with a pizza dough baked with finely sliced red onions then topped with crème fraiche (an elegant French variant of sour cream), finely chopped shallots, lox, salmon caviar, and finely chopped dill. The pizza dough is the element taken from the conventional pizza, and the Jewish elements are the lox, crème fraiche (sour cream a la Wolfgang Puck), onion, and so on.

 As an object in the world, the Jewish pizza is just what it is: lox, dough, onions, a cultured cream, etc. But conceptually (and tastewise), it is a blend of elements from pizzas and elements from Jewish cooking. As the Jewish pizza has become a staple of Puck's repertoire, it has become a food concept of its own. Although for the most part it leaves in place the concept of pizza and the concept of Jewish cooking, it makes a slight extension of both concepts and thereby extends the idea of Jewish cooking and the idea of what a pizza is.

 According to Blending Theory, this would be a blend with two input spaces: a space structured by parts of the conceptual domain of ordinary pizza and a space structured by parts of the conceptual domain of Jewish cooking. The idea of Jewish pizza is a conceptual blend of the ideas in those input spaces. The space containing the idea of the Jewish pizza is the blended space—a new conceptual product of an operation of blending elements.

 The Neural Theory of Language provides a neural underpinning for the theory of conceptual blends. Blends are formed by both neural mappings and neural bindings. In a neural binding, two conceptual entities are seen as being the same entity. In the Jewish pizza, the pizza topping is the same entity as the lox with crème fraiche. The neural mapping would link the pizza schema with the open\-faced loxon\-bagel schema. Such a neural structure, with both mappings and bindings, forms a blend at the conceptual level.

 Here we see what the two theories accomplish, one at the cognitive level and the other at the neural level.

 The Jewish pizza blend is obviously a literal blend, so literal that you can actually make one and eat it. Fauconnier and Turner (2002\) have observed that there are also metaphoric blends, blends that arise when one input space is structured by the source domain of an existing conceptual metaphor in the conceptual system, and the other input space is structured by the target domain of that metaphor. Of course, there need not be a blended space whenever a conceptual metaphor is used. Take a sentence like "Steel prices rose. " This is an instance of More Is Up. When steel sellers are charging more for their steel, the situation is conceptualized and spoken of in terms of a spatial rise. But there need be no entity that is rising in space.

 However, blends are possible with this metaphor. Imagine a graph of changes in steel prices that is structured by the More Is Up metaphor—"higher" prices are literally higher on the graph—and by the Change is Motion and Fictive Motion metaphors, in which changes are movements and a line represents the path of a moving entity from left to right. In this graph, the line is tilted higher on the right side, indicating in the literal drawing that prices have become higher metaphorically. What makes this a blend is a binding (in Neural Theory of Language terms): an identification of prices charged with the heights of points on the line in the graph.

 Over more than a decade, Fauconnier and Turner have collected hundreds of examples of imaginative blends, including metaphorical blends, demonstrating beyond doubt that blends are a feature of our everyday mental life. Fauconnier and Turner have also looked at length at the properties of blends, discovering principles that make for good blends. In the Neural Theory of Language, the corresponding enterprise is to explain, in terms of neural computation, neural learning and neural optimization, why the particular properties and principles found by Fauconnier and Turner exist.

 The Neural Theory of Language and Blending Theory are very different enterprises, which happen to overlap in subject matter in certain cases. Blending theory focuses on conceptual integration at the level of spaces, the level of the formation of particular cases from preexisting conceptual structures. It also looks at the conventionalization of these blends, a process by which blends may become part of conceptual structure.

 The Neural Theory of Language also focuses on conceptual integration. In addition, it seeks a precise, overall computational neural account of language as a whole and of the ideas expressed by language. It is concerned both with formally characterizing parameterizations and with precisely building computational models of embodied enactments. The Neural Theory of Language also concentrates on modeling learning, both the learning of concepts and the learning of language to express those concepts. So far as metaphor is concerned, the Neural Theory of Language attempts to explain on neural grounds why we have the primary metaphors we have.

 Some Corrections and Clarifications

 This book was our first attempt to spell out the nature of metaphorical thought and its relation to language. Inevitably, we made some mistakes. Here are some revisions:

 The division of metaphors into three types—orienta\-tional, ontological, and structural—was artificial. All metaphors are structural (in that they map structures to structures); all are ontological (in that they create target domain entities); and many are orientational (in that they map orientational image\-schemas).

 We did not yet see the profundity of primary metaphor, and, as a result, some of our analyses were incomplete. This was evident, for example, in our analysis of Argument Is War. Many readers have correctly observed that most people learn about argument before they learn about war. The metaphor actually originates in childhood with the primary metaphor Argument Is Struggle. All children struggle against the physical manipulations of their parents; and, as language is learned, the physical struggle comes to be accompanied by words. The conflation of physical struggle with associated words in the development of all children is the basis for the primary metaphor Argument Is Struggle. As we grow up, we learn about more extended and violent struggles like battles and wars, and the metaphor is extended via that knowledge.

 The distinction between metaphor and metonymy is real but often confusing. Here is the basic distinction:

 
> In a metaphor, there are two domains: the target domain, which is constituted by the immediate subject matter, and the source domain, in which important metaphorical reasoning takes place and that provides the source concepts used in that reasoning. Metaphorical language has literal meaning in the source domain. In addition, a metaphoric mapping is multiple, that is, two or more elements are mapped to two or more other elements. Image\- schema structure is preserved in the mapping—interiors of containers map to interiors, exteriors map to exteriors; sources of motion to sources, goals to goals, and so on.
> 
>  In a metonymy, there is only one domain: the immediate subject matter. There is only one mapping; typically the metonymic source maps to the metonymic target (the referent) so that one item in the domain can stand for the other.

 Although these are considerable differences, it is understandable why there is occasional confusion between metaphor and metonymy. First, in both cases there is a conceptual mapping which has a reflection in language: a linguistic expression with meaning A expressing meaning B. If you are mostly looking at the surface forms of the language, rather than at the conceptual systems and inferential structure, you may not be looking in the right place to notice the difference. Second, there is neural coactivation in both metaphor and metonymy. In metaphor, there is coactivation of two domains; in metonymy there is coactivation of two frame elements. However, a single complex frame may be formed from simple frames coming from two different conceptual domains. For example, the Time\-For\-A\-Trip frame brings together the domains of Time and Space in a way that is not metaphorical. In this frame, there is a correlation between time and distance, with a mapping from times to distances that can be traveled in those times. Thus there can be a Time\-For\-Distance metonymy, as in:

 (Metonymy) San Francisco is a half hour from Berkeley.

 Here the time (a half hour) stands metonymically for the distance. Notice that the time is from the Time domain and the distance is from the Space domain. This is a mapping of an element from one domain to an element of another. It is a metonymy, not a metaphor, because the two domains are part of a single, literal frame and because there is a single mapping, not a multiple mapping.

 Compare this case with the spatial metaphor for time that arises from a correlation in experience between time and location, as in:

 (Metaphor) Chanukah is close to Christmas.

 In the metaphor, Time is the target domain and Space is the source domain. In the sentence given, the relationship between the times of the two holidays is given metaphorically in terms of space (close to). Here Time is the subject matter of the sentence and Space is not; it is only the conceptual source. In the metonymy case, the relationship between time and space (the time for the trip) is the subject matter of the sentence.

 The moral is this: When distinguishing metaphor and metonymy, one must not look only at the meanings of a single linguistic expression and whether there are two domains involved. Instead, one must determine how the expression is used. Do the two domains form a single, complex subject matter in use with a single mapping? If so, you have metonymy. Or, can the domains be separate in use, with a number of mappings and with one of the domains forming the subject matter (the target domain), while the other domain (the source) is the basis of significant inference and a number of linguistic expressions? If this is the case, then you have metaphor.

 Applications of Metaphor Theory

 In the twenty\-five years since we first discovered conceptual metaphor, researchers in fields as diverse as literary theory, legal studies, linguistics, and the philosophy of science have made exciting applications of the theory. They have identified conceptual metaphors at the heart of poetry, law, politics, psychology, physics, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Their research reveals how metaphor structures how we think—and even what thoughts are permitted—in the following intellectual disciplines:

 Literary Analysis. In More Than Cool Reason (1989\), Lakoff and Turner demonstrated that metaphors in poetry are, for the most part, extensions and special cases of stable, conventional conceptual metaphors used in everyday thought and language. The metaphoric innovations of poets are shown thereby to consist not in the totally new creation of metaphoric thought but in the marshalling of already existing forms of metaphoric thought to form new extensions and combinations of old metaphorical mappings.

 Lakoff and Turner also showed that conventional conceptual metaphor lies at the heart of proverbs; and, in Death Is the Mother of Beauty (1987\), Turner showed how everyday conceptual metaphor can form the basis of allegory when applied to plot structure. In The Literary Mind (1996\), Turner then demonstrated how metaphoric blends lie behind the construction of fables and of other common products of the literary imagination.

 The metaphorical basis of the moral dimension of literature becomes apparent from the discussion of metaphor and morality by Johnson in Moral Imagination (1993\), by Lakoff in Moral Politics (1996\), and by Lakoff and Johnson in Philosophy in the Flesh (1999\).

 Politics, Law; and Social Issues. The most important application of the theory of conceptual metaphor has been in the areas of law, politics, and social issues. Legal theorist Steven Winter has written extensively in law review articles and in a major book, A Clearing in the Forest (2001\), about the central role of metaphor in legal reasoning. Legal metaphors abound, from the metaphor of the Corporation As Person (with First Amendment rights), to the metaphor of real property as bundles of rights, to the evolving metaphorical understanding of intellectual property. As Winter shows, it is common for the Supreme Court to use metaphors to extend legal categories developed in previous decisions. Metaphor is thus a powerful legal tool that has effects throughout our social lives.

 Lakoff's essay "Metaphor and War, " distributed to many millions over the Internet on the eve of the Gulf War, remains one of the most important analyses not only of the use of metaphor by the U. S. government to persuade the populace but also of the role of conceptual metaphors in planning foreign policy. It shows in detail how the metaphors used within the U. S. government to conceptualize the political and economic situation in Iraq systematically hid the most dreadful consequences of that war. The chapter on rationality in Lakoff and Johnson's Philosophy in the Flesh (1999\) is a thorough analysis of the metaphorical structure of the rational actor model used widely in economics and politics and of what that model hides.

 Lakoff's Moral Politics (1996\) analyzes the political worldviews of conservatives and progressives in America. Lakoff asks why their respective views on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, taxation, social programs, the environment, and art fit together into two opposing frameworks that are each sensible and coherent. The answer is that these views are held together by pervasive metaphors for morality that are in turn organized by opposing idealized models of the family. Conservative intellectuals have explicitly articulated the main outlines of the family\-morality\-politics connections, but, for the most part, progressives have not. The book provides progressives with a guide to understanding their own moral system. It shows how that system unites various kinds of progressives and what the overall moral basis is behind progressive as well as conservative politics. The analysis applies to every major social issue in America.

 Psychology. Metaphor analysis has proved important for both cognitive and clinical psychology. Cognitive psychology is dominated by the old idea that concepts are all literal and disembodied. The literature on metaphor theory provides overwhelming evidence against that view and opens the possibility for a much more interesting cognitive psychology, which to some extent already exists (Gibbs 1994\). For example, considerable research has been done on the metaphorical conceptualization of emotions (Lakoff 1987, Case Study 1; Kövecses 1990\) as well as on metaphors for the self (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, chapter 13\), mind, memory, and attention (Fernandez\-Duque and Johnson 1999\).

 The promise of metaphor theory for clinical psychology is enormous. We now know enough of our unconscious metaphor systems to reveal how they affect our lives as individuals and what personal metaphors we have developed over our lifetimes to make sense of our lives. We also know what basic metaphors there are for marriage and love and how spouses may differ in their metaphors. Such differences can lead to enormous difficulties. Lakoff's Moral Politics describes crucially important differences in family models and how these differences may affect later life (1996\). Though skilled therapists may have well\-developed intuitions in this area, metaphor theory provides a systematic guide to the cognitive and affective dimensions of our sense of self. (For a discussion of the application of metaphor theory to dreams, see Lakoff 1997\).

 Mathematics. If any area has been taken to be literal, disembodied, and objective, it is mathematics. Yet Lakoff and Nunez have shown that mathematics too is metaphorical through and through (2000\). Take the number line. Numbers don't have to be points on a line. It is a metaphor that Numbers Are Points on a Line, just as it is a metaphor that Numbers Are Sets, which is used in the set\-theoretical foundations for mathematics developed in the late nineteenth century. Where Mathematics Comes From, by Lakoff and Nunez (2000\), is a massive study of the metaphorical structure of mathematics, from arithmetic to set theory and logic, to forms of infinity, to classical advanced mathematics. Mathematics turns out not to be a disembodied, literal, objective feature of the universe but rather an embodied, largely metaphorical, stable intellectual edifice constructed by human beings with human brains living in our physical world.

 Cognitive Lingustics. Metaphor Theory is a central subdiscipline of the field of cognitive linguistics, which seeks to provide explanatory foundations for conceptual systems and language in the general study of the brain and the mind. As such, it draws on, and seeks to integrate, recent work in cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology to form a unified picture that can explain as many aspects of language as possible, from syntax to semantics to discourse. Other central developments in cognitive linguistics include:

 1. the semantics of closed\-class elements such as spatial relations (Talmy 2000\)
2. studies of category structure, including basic\-level categories, prototypes, and radial categories (Lakoff 1987\)
3. mental spaces (Fauconnier 1985; Fauconnier and Sweetser 1996\)
4. frame semantics (Fillmore 1982, 1985; Sweetser 1990\)
5. blended spaces (Fauconnier and Turner 1998, 2002\)
6. cognitive grammar (Langacker 1986, 1990, 1991\)
7. cognitive construction grammar (Goldberg 1995; Lakoff 1987, Case Study 3\).

 The Neural Theory of Language is being developed. It seeks to provide a unified theory of thought and language based on neural computation (Regier 1996; Narayanan 1997; Feldman and Lakoff, forthcoming).

 Philosophy. Metaphors We Live By began partly as an attempt to answer influential claims about metaphor made by two major contemporary American philosophers—Donald Davidson, who claimed that metaphors are meaningless, and John Searle, who claimed that there are semantic and pragmatic principles that allow one to assign literal meanings to metaphorical sentences. We realized that their arguments rested on common assumptions held both in analytic philosophy and throughout the Western tradition, namely, that concepts are all conscious, literal, and disembodied, that is, not crucially shaped by the body and brain.

 As we discuss in the final chapters of this book, the facts of conceptual metaphor theory are incompatible with many major assumptions of Western philosophy: it is just not true that all thought is conscious, literal, and disembodied. Over the two decades since we finished this book, we have struggled to figure out what philosophy would look like if we started with the empirical results from embodied cognitive science about the mind and language and reconstructed philosophy anew. The results of these labors are presented in Philosophy in the Flesh (1999\), which is a broad and deep rethinking of the nature of:

 * truth and science;
* basic philosophical concepts such as time, events, causation, the mind, the self, morality, being and essence;
* the metaphorical structure that defines the fundamental forms of reason used by great philosophers from the Presocratics, Plato, and Aristotle, to Descartes and Kant, to contemporary analytic philosophers such as Quine;
* the consequences for a new view of what a human being is, what religion and spiritual experience are, and what the job of philosophy itself is.

 Summary

 The theory of metaphor has come a long way from the humble beginnings presented in this slim volume. Yet, most of the key ideas in this book have been either sustained or developed further by recent empirical research in cognitive linguistics and in cognitive science generally. These key ideas are the following:

 
> —Metaphors are fundamentally conceptual in nature; metaphorical language is secondary.
> 
>  —Conceptual metaphors are grounded in everyday experience.
> 
>  —Abstract thought is largely, though not entirely, metaphorical.
> 
>  —Metaphorical thought is unavoidable, ubiquitous, and mostly unconscious.
> 
>  —Abstract concepts have a literal core but are extended by metaphors, often by many mutually inconsistent metaphors.
> 
>  —Abstract concepts are not complete without metaphors. For example, love is not love without metaphors of magic, attraction, madness, union, nurturance, and so on.
> 
>  —Our conceptual systems are not consistent overall, since the metaphors used to reason about concepts may be inconsistent.
> 
>  —We live our lives on the basis of inferences we derive via metaphor.

 The Present Situation

 In spite of the massive and growing evidence for them, our basic claims have nonetheless met resistance for an obvious reason: they are inconsistent with assumptions that many people in the academic world and elsewhere first learned and that shaped the research agendas they still pursue. Many mainstream philosophers, linguists, and psychologists either have vehemently denied these claims or have preferred to ignore them and to go about their ordinary business as if the claims were false. The reason is clear— our claims strike at the heart of centuries\-old assumptions about the nature of meaning, thought, and language. If the new empirical results are taken seriously, then people throughout our culture have to rethink some of their most cherished beliefs about what science and philosophy are and reconsider their values from a new perspective.

 Above all, the key sticking point is the existence of conceptual metaphor. If conceptual metaphors are real, then all literalist and objectivist views of meaning and knowledge are false. We can no longer pretend to build an account of concepts and knowledge on objective, literal foundations. This constitutes a profound challenge to many of the traditional ways of thinking about what it means to be human, about how the mind works, and about our nature as social and cultural creatures.

 At the same time, what we have discovered is fundamentally at odds with certain key tenets of postmodernist thought, especially those that claim that meaning is ungrounded and simply an arbitrary cultural construction.

 What has been discovered about primary metaphor, for example, simply does not bear this out. There appear to be both universal metaphors and cultural variation.

 For these reasons, this book remains just as controversial and radical today as when it first appeared. It calls into question business as usual and requires new collaborative cross\-disciplinary methods of inquiry.
